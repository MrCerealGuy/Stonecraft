#    This file contains information (some of which was previously stored in
#    stonecraft.conf.example) that cannot be automatically generated from
#    builtin/settingtypes.txt.
#    This file contains a list of settings and their default value for stonecraft.conf

#    By default, all the settings are commented and not functional.
#    Uncomment settings by removing the preceding #.

#    stonecraft.conf is read by default from:
#    ../stonecraft.conf
#    ../../stonecraft.conf
#    Any other path can be chosen by passing the path as a parameter
#    to the program, eg. "stonecraft.exe --config ../stonecraft.conf.example".

# Noise parameters and formats

#    Noise parameters can be specified as a set of positional values, for example:
#
#    Offset, scale, (x, y, z spread factors), seed offset, octaves, persistence, lacunarity
# mgv6_np_terrain_base = -4, 20, (250, 250, 250), 82341, 5, 0.6, 2.0
#
#    Or the group format can be used instead, for example:
#
# mgv6_np_terrain_base = {
#    offset      = -4,
#    scale       = 20,
#    spread      = (250, 250, 250),
#    seed        = 82341,
#    octaves     = 5,
#    persistence = 0.6,
#    lacunarity  = 2.0,
#    flags       = "defaults"
# }
#
#    The advanced settings menu does not yet support the group format.
#    Only the group format supports noise flags which are needed for eased noise.
#    Mgv5 uses eased noise for np_ground so this is shown in group format below
#    and is not present in the advanced settings menu.

# Mapgen v5

#    Noise parameter in group format, unsupported by advanced settings menu but
#    settable in stonecraft.conf.
#    See documentation of noise parameter formats above.
#
#    3D noise defining terrain.
#    type: noise_params
# mgv5_np_ground = {
#    offset      = 0,
#    scale       = 40,
#    spread      = (80, 80, 80),
#    seed        = 983240,
#    octaves     = 4,
#    persistence = 0.55,
#    lacunarity  = 2.0,
#    flags       = "eased"
# }
