# This file contains all settings displayed in the world creation menu.

# General format:

#    - path
#    - filepath
#    - key (will be ignored in GUI, since a special key change dialog exists)
#    - flags
#    - noise_params
#
# `type_args` can be:
#   * int:
#            - default
#            - default min max
#   * string:
#            - default (if default is not specified then "" is set)

#
# Comments directly above a setting are bound to this setting.
# All other comments are ignored.
#
# Comments and (Readable name) are handled by gettext.
# Comments should be complete sentences that describe the setting and possibly
#  give the user additional useful insight.
# Sections are marked by a single line in the format: [Section Name]
# Sub-section are marked by adding * in front of the section name: [*Sub-section]
# Sub-sub-sections have two * etc.
# There shouldn't be too much settings per category; settings that shouldn't be
#  modified by the "average user" should be in (sub-)categories called "Advanced".
