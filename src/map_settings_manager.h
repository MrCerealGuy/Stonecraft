/*
	MapSettingsManager is a centralized object for management (creating,
	loading, storing, saving, etc.) of config settings related to the Map.

	It has two phases: the initial r/w "gather and modify settings" state, and
	the final r/o "read and save settings" state.

	The typical use case is, in order, as follows:
	- Create a MapSettingsManager object
	- Try to load map metadata into it from the metadata file
	- Manually view and modify the current configuration as desired through a
	  Settings-like interface
	- When all modifications are finished, create a 'Parameters' object
	  containing the finalized, active parameters.  This could be passed along
	  to whichever Map-related objects that may require it.
	- Save these active settings to the metadata file when requested
