<p><strong>Not So Simple Mobs</strong> are more complex mobs in Stonecraft, for the purpose of increasing the difficulty of playing. There are more than 50 different mobs. They are divided in groups, each one who lives in a different biome.</p>
<p>They all drop life energies. With life energies you can craft tools and special powerful weapons to defend yourself from the monsters.</p>
