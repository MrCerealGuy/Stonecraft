Stonecraft is an InfiniMiner/Minecraft inspired game started in 2016 based on the Minetest open-source voxel game engine. It will be kept lightweight enough to run on fairly old hardware.

Stonecraft is open-source and free, released under the GNU General Public License v3.0. Thanks a lot to the Minetest community, to "Notch" the creator of Minecraft and to Linus Torvalds, the creator of the free operating system Linux.

Like in other block sandbox games, you can build and destroy blocks everywhere in a near infinite world. There are two game modes, in survival mode you can loose your life, so you have to fight against many creatures and hunger in a dangerous world with many dungeons and woods of spiders. In creative mode you have access to all blocks, items and tools to build all you can imagine. Choose if you want to play either as singleplayer or multiplayer on servers with your friends. If you like, you can run your own Stonecraft server.
