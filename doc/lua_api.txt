Minetest Lua Modding API Reference
==================================
* More information at <http://www.minetest.net/>
* Developer Wiki: <http://dev.minetest.net/>

Introduction
------------
Content and functionality can be added to Minetest using Lua scripting
in run-time loaded mods.

A mod is a self-contained bunch of scripts, textures and other related
things, which is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest.

Mods are contained and ran solely on the server side. Definitions and media
files are automatically transferred to the client.

If you see a deficiency in the API, feel free to attempt to add the
functionality in the engine and API, and to document it here.

Programming in Lua
------------------
If you have any difficulty in understanding this, please read
[Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/).

Startup
-------
Mods are loaded during server startup from the mod load paths by running
the `init.lua` scripts in a shared environment.

Paths
-----
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=1` (Windows release, local build)
    *  `$path_user`:
        * Linux: `<build directory>`
        * Windows: `<build directory>`
    * `$path_share`
        * Linux: `<build directory>`
        * Windows:  `<build directory>`
* `RUN_IN_PLACE=0`: (Linux release)
    * `$path_share`
        * Linux: `/usr/share/minetest`
        * Windows: `<install directory>/minetest-0.4.x`
    * `$path_user`:
        * Linux: `$HOME/.minetest`
        * Windows: `C:/users/<user>/AppData/minetest` (maybe)

Games
-----
Games are looked up from:

* `$path_share/games/gameid/`
* `$path_user/games/gameid/`

where `gameid` is unique to each game.

The game directory contains the file `game.conf`, which contains:

    name = <Human-readable full name of the game>

e.g.

    name = Minetest

Optionally, game.conf can also contain:

    disallowed_mapgens = <comma-separated mapgens>

e.g.

    disallowed_mapgens = v5,v6,flat

These mapgens are removed from the list of mapgens for the game.

The game directory can contain the file minetest.conf, which will be used
to set default settings when running the particular game.
It can also contain a settingtypes.txt in the same format as the one in builtin.
This settingtypes.txt will be parsed by the menu and the settings will be displayed
in the "Games" category in the settings tab.

### Menu images

Games can provide custom main menu images. They are put inside a `menu` directory
inside the game directory.

The images are named `$identifier.png`, where `$identifier` is
one of `overlay,background,footer,header`.
If you want to specify multiple images for one identifier, add additional images named
like `$identifier.$n.png`, with an ascending number $n starting with 1, and a random
image will be chosen from the provided ones.


Mod load path
-------------
Generic:

* `$path_share/games/gameid/mods/`
* `$path_share/mods/`
* `$path_user/games/gameid/mods/`
* `$path_user/mods/` (User-installed mods)
* `$worldpath/worldmods/`

In a run-in-place version (e.g. the distributed windows version):

* `minetest-0.4.x/games/gameid/mods/`
* `minetest-0.4.x/mods/` (User-installed mods)
* `minetest-0.4.x/worlds/worldname/worldmods/`

On an installed version on Linux:

* `/usr/share/minetest/games/gameid/mods/`
* `$HOME/.minetest/mods/` (User-installed mods)
* `$HOME/.minetest/worlds/worldname/worldmods`

Mod load path for world-specific games
--------------------------------------
It is possible to include a game in a world; in this case, no mods or
games are loaded or checked from anywhere else.

This is useful for e.g. adventure worlds.

This happens if the following directory exists:

    $world/game/

Mods should be then be placed in:

    $world/game/mods/

Modpack support
----------------
Mods can be put in a subdirectory, if the parent directory, which otherwise
should be a mod, contains a file named `modpack.txt`. This file shall be
empty, except for lines starting with `#`, which are comments.

Mod directory structure
------------------------

    mods
    |-- modname
    |   |-- depends.txt
    |   |-- screenshot.png
    |   |-- description.txt
    |   |-- settingtypes.txt
    |   |-- init.lua
    |   |-- models
    |   |-- textures
    |   |   |-- modname_stuff.png
    |   |   `-- modname_something_else.png
    |   |-- sounds
    |   |-- media
    |   |-- locale
    |   `-- <custom data>
    `-- another


### modname
The location of this directory can be fetched by using
`minetest.get_modpath(modname)`.

### `depends.txt`
List of mods that have to be loaded before loading this mod.

A single line contains a single modname.

Optional dependencies can be defined by appending a question mark
to a single modname. This means that if the specified mod
is missing, it does not prevent this mod from being loaded.

### `screenshot.png`
A screenshot shown in the mod manager within the main menu. It should
have an aspect ratio of 3:2 and a minimum size of 300Ã—200 pixels.

### `description.txt`
A file containing a description to be shown in the Mods tab of the mainmenu.

### `settingtypes.txt`
A file in the same format as the one in builtin. It will be parsed by the
settings menu and the settings will be displayed in the "Mods" category.

### `init.lua`
The main Lua script. Running this script should register everything it
wants to register. Subsequent execution depends on minetest calling the
registered callbacks.

`minetest.settings` can be used to read custom or existing settings at load
time, if necessary. (See `Settings`)

### `models`
Models for entities or meshnodes.

### `textures`, `sounds`, `media`
Media files (textures, sounds, whatever) that will be transferred to the
client and will be available for use by the mod.

### `locale`
Translation files for the clients. (See `Translations`)

Naming convention for registered textual names
----------------------------------------------
Registered names should generally be in this format:

    `modname:<whatever>`

`<whatever>` can have these characters:

    a-zA-Z0-9_

This is to prevent conflicting names from corrupting maps and is
enforced by the mod loader.

### Example
In the mod `experimental`, there is the ideal item/node/entity name `tnt`.
So the name should be `experimental:tnt`.

Enforcement can be overridden by prefixing the name with `:`. This can
be used for overriding the registrations of some other mod.

Example: Any mod can redefine `experimental:tnt` by using the name

    :experimental:tnt

when registering it.
(also that mod is required to have `experimental` as a dependency)

The `:` prefix can also be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

Aliases
-------
Aliases can be added by using `minetest.register_alias(name, convert_to)` or
`minetest.register_alias_force(name, convert_to)`.

This converts anything called `name` to `convert_to`.

The only difference between `minetest.register_alias` and
`minetest.register_alias_force` is that if an item called `name` exists,
`minetest.register_alias` will do nothing while
`minetest.register_alias_force` will unregister it.

This can be used for maintaining backwards compatibility.

This can also set quick access names for things, e.g. if
you have an item called `epiclylongmodname:stuff`, you could do

    minetest.register_alias("stuff", "epiclylongmodname:stuff")

and be able to use `/giveme stuff`.

Mapgen aliases
--------------
In a game, a certain number of these must be set to tell core mapgens which
of the game's nodes are to be used by the core mapgens. For example:

    minetest.register_alias("mapgen_stone", "default:stone")

### Aliases needed for all mapgens except Mapgen v6

Base terrain:

"mapgen_stone"
"mapgen_water_source"
"mapgen_river_water_source"

Caves:

"mapgen_lava_source"

Dungeons:

Only needed for registered biomes where 'node_stone' is stone:
"mapgen_cobble"
"mapgen_stair_cobble"
"mapgen_mossycobble"
Only needed for registered biomes where 'node_stone' is desert stone:
"mapgen_desert_stone"
"mapgen_stair_desert_stone"
Only needed for registered biomes where 'node_stone' is sandstone:
"mapgen_sandstone"
"mapgen_sandstonebrick"
"mapgen_stair_sandstone_block"

### Aliases needed for Mapgen v6

Terrain and biomes:

"mapgen_stone"
"mapgen_water_source"
"mapgen_lava_source"
"mapgen_dirt"
"mapgen_dirt_with_grass"
"mapgen_sand"
"mapgen_gravel"
"mapgen_desert_stone"
"mapgen_desert_sand"
"mapgen_dirt_with_snow"
"mapgen_snowblock"
"mapgen_snow"
"mapgen_ice"

Flora:

"mapgen_tree"
"mapgen_leaves"
"mapgen_apple"
"mapgen_jungletree"
"mapgen_jungleleaves"
"mapgen_junglegrass"
"mapgen_pine_tree"
"mapgen_pine_needles"

Dungeons:

"mapgen_cobble"
"mapgen_stair_cobble"
"mapgen_mossycobble"
"mapgen_stair_desert_stone"

Textures
--------
Mods should generally prefix their textures with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name `foomod`, a texture could be called:

    foomod_foothing.png

Textures are referred to by their complete name, or alternatively by
stripping out the file extension:

* e.g. `foomod_foothing.png`
* e.g. `foomod_foothing`

Texture modifiers
-----------------
There are various texture modifiers that can be used
to generate textures on-the-fly.

### Texture overlaying
Textures can be overlaid by putting a `^` between them.

Example:

    default_dirt.png^default_grass_side.png

`default_grass_side.png` is overlaid over `default_dirt.png`.
The texture with the lower resolution will be automatically upscaled to
the higher resolution texture.

### Texture grouping
Textures can be grouped together by enclosing them in `(` and `)`.

Example: `cobble.png^(thing1.png^thing2.png)`

A texture for `thing1.png^thing2.png` is created and the resulting
texture is overlaid on top of `cobble.png`.

### Escaping
Modifiers that accept texture names (e.g. `[combine`) accept escaping to allow
passing complex texture names as arguments. Escaping is done with backslash and
is required for `^` and `:`.

Example: `cobble.png^[lowpart:50:color.png\^[mask\:trans.png`

The lower 50 percent of `color.png^[mask:trans.png` are overlaid
on top of `cobble.png`.

### Advanced texture modifiers

#### Crack
* `[crack:<n>:<p>`
* `[cracko:<n>:<p>`
* `[crack:<t>:<n>:<p>`
* `[cracko:<t>:<n>:<p>`

Parameters:
* `<t>` = tile count (in each direction)
* `<n>` = animation frame count
* `<p>` = current animation frame

Draw a step of the crack animation on the texture.
`crack` draws it normally, while `cracko` lays it over, keeping transparent pixels intact.

Example:

    default_cobble.png^[crack:10:1

#### `[combine:<w>x<h>:<x1>,<y1>=<file1>:<x2>,<y2>=<file2>:...`
* `<w>` = width
* `<h>` = height
* `<x>` = x position
* `<y>` = y position
* `<file>` = texture to combine

Creates a texture of size `<w>` times `<h>` and blits the listed files to their
specified coordinates.

Example:

    [combine:16x32:0,0=default_cobble.png:0,16=default_wood.png

#### `[resize:<w>x<h>`
Resizes the texture to the given dimensions.

Example:

    default_sandstone.png^[resize:16x16

#### `[opacity:<r>`
Makes the base image transparent according to the given ratio.

`r` must be between 0 and 255.
0 means totally transparent. 255 means totally opaque.

Example:

    default_sandstone.png^[opacity:127

#### `[invert:<mode>`
Inverts the given channels of the base image.
Mode may contain the characters "r", "g", "b", "a".
Only the channels that are mentioned in the mode string will be inverted.

Example:

    default_apple.png^[invert:rgb

#### `[brighten`
Brightens the texture.

Example:

    tnt_tnt_side.png^[brighten

#### `[noalpha`
Makes the texture completely opaque.

Example:

    default_leaves.png^[noalpha

#### `[makealpha:<r>,<g>,<b>`
Convert one color to transparency.

Example:

    default_cobble.png^[makealpha:128,128,128

#### `[transform<t>`
* `<t>` = transformation(s) to apply

Rotates and/or flips the image.

`<t>` can be a number (between 0 and 7) or a transform name.
Rotations are counter-clockwise.

    0  I      identity
    1  R90    rotate by 90 degrees
    2  R180   rotate by 180 degrees
    3  R270   rotate by 270 degrees
    4  FX     flip X
    5  FXR90  flip X then rotate by 90 degrees
    6  FY     flip Y
    7  FYR90  flip Y then rotate by 90 degrees

Example:

    default_stone.png^[transformFXR90

#### `[inventorycube{<top>{<left>{<right>`
Escaping does not apply here and `^` is replaced by `&` in texture names instead.

Create an inventory cube texture using the side textures.

Example:

    [inventorycube{grass.png{dirt.png&grass_side.png{dirt.png&grass_side.png

Creates an inventorycube with `grass.png`, `dirt.png^grass_side.png` and
`dirt.png^grass_side.png` textures

#### `[lowpart:<percent>:<file>`
Blit the lower `<percent>`% part of `<file>` on the texture.

Example:

    base.png^[lowpart:25:overlay.png

#### `[verticalframe:<t>:<n>`
* `<t>` = animation frame count
* `<n>` = current animation frame

Crops the texture to a frame of a vertical animation.

Example:

    default_torch_animated.png^[verticalframe:16:8

#### `[mask:<file>`
Apply a mask to the base image.

The mask is applied using binary AND.

#### `[sheet:<w>x<h>:<x>,<y>`
Retrieves a tile at position x,y from the base image
which it assumes to be a tilesheet with dimensions w,h.


#### `[colorize:<color>:<ratio>`
Colorize the textures with the given color.
`<color>` is specified as a `ColorString`.
`<ratio>` is an int ranging from 0 to 255 or the word "`alpha`".  If
it is an int, then it specifies how far to interpolate between the
colors where 0 is only the texture color and 255 is only `<color>`. If
omitted, the alpha of `<color>` will be used as the ratio.  If it is
the word "`alpha`", then each texture pixel will contain the RGB of
`<color>` and the alpha of `<color>` multiplied by the alpha of the
texture pixel.

#### `[multiply:<color>`
Multiplies texture colors with the given color.
`<color>` is specified as a `ColorString`.
Result is more like what you'd expect if you put a color on top of another
color. Meaning white surfaces get a lot of your new color while black parts don't
change very much.

Hardware coloring
-----------------
The goal of hardware coloring is to simplify the creation of
colorful nodes. If your textures use the same pattern, and they only
differ in their color (like colored wool blocks), you can use hardware
coloring instead of creating and managing many texture files.
All of these methods use color multiplication (so a white-black texture
with red coloring will result in red-black color).

### Static coloring
This method is useful if you wish to create nodes/items with
the same texture, in different colors, each in a new node/item definition.

#### Global color
When you register an item or node, set its `color` field (which accepts a
`ColorSpec`) to the desired color.

An `ItemStack`s static color can be overwritten by the `color` metadata
field. If you set that field to a `ColorString`, that color will be used.

#### Tile color
Each tile may have an individual static color, which overwrites every
other coloring methods. To disable the coloring of a face,
set its color to white (because multiplying with white does nothing).
You can set the `color` property of the tiles in the node's definition
if the tile is in table format.

### Palettes
For nodes and items which can have many colors, a palette is more
suitable. A palette is a texture, which can contain up to 256 pixels.
Each pixel is one possible color for the node/item.
You can register one node/item, which can have up to 256 colors.

#### Palette indexing
When using palettes, you always provide a pixel index for the given
node or `ItemStack`. The palette is read from left to right and from
top to bottom. If the palette has less than 256 pixels, then it is
stretched to contain exactly 256 pixels (after arranging the pixels
to one line). The indexing starts from 0.

Examples:
* 16x16 palette, index = 0: the top left corner
* 16x16 palette, index = 4: the fifth pixel in the first row
* 16x16 palette, index = 16: the pixel below the top left corner
* 16x16 palette, index = 255: the bottom right corner
* 2 (width)x4 (height) palette, index=31: the top left corner.
  The palette has 8 pixels, so each pixel is stretched to 32 pixels,
  to ensure the total 256 pixels.
* 2x4 palette, index=32: the top right corner
* 2x4 palette, index=63: the top right corner
* 2x4 palette, index=64: the pixel below the top left corner

#### Using palettes with items
When registering an item, set the item definition's `palette` field to
a texture. You can also use texture modifiers.

The `ItemStack`'s color depends on the `palette_index` field of the
stack's metadata. `palette_index` is an integer, which specifies the
index of the pixel to use.

#### Linking palettes with nodes
When registering a node, set the item definition's `palette` field to
a texture. You can also use texture modifiers.
The node's color depends on its `param2`, so you also must set an
appropriate `drawtype`:
* `drawtype = "color"` for nodes which use their full `param2` for
  palette indexing. These nodes can have 256 different colors.
  The palette should contain 256 pixels.
* `drawtype = "colorwallmounted"` for nodes which use the first
  five bits (most significant) of `param2` for palette indexing.
  The remaining three bits are describing rotation, as in `wallmounted`
  draw type. Division by 8 yields the palette index (without stretching the
  palette). These nodes can have 32 different colors, and the palette
  should contain 32 pixels.
  Examples:
  * `param2 = 17` is 2 * 8 + 1, so the rotation is 1 and the third (= 2 + 1)
    pixel will be picked from the palette.
  * `param2 = 35` is 4 * 8 + 3, so the rotation is 3 and the fifth (= 4 + 1)
    pixel will be picked from the palette.
* `drawtype = "colorfacedir"` for nodes which use the first
  three bits of `param2` for palette indexing. The remaining
  five bits are describing rotation, as in `facedir` draw type.
  Division by 32 yields the palette index (without stretching the
  palette). These nodes can have 8 different colors, and the
  palette should contain 8 pixels.
  Examples:
  * `param2 = 17` is 0 * 32 + 17, so the rotation is 17 and the
    first (= 0 + 1) pixel will be picked from the palette.
  * `param2 = 35` is 1 * 32 + 3, so the rotation is 3 and the
    second (= 1 + 1) pixel will be picked from the palette.

To colorize a node on the map, set its `param2` value (according
to the node's draw type).

### Conversion between nodes in the inventory and the on the map
Static coloring is the same for both cases, there is no need
for conversion.

If the `ItemStack`'s metadata contains the `color` field, it will be
lost on placement, because nodes on the map can only use palettes.

If the `ItemStack`'s metadata contains the `palette_index` field, it is
automatically transferred between node and item forms by the engine,
when a player digs or places a colored node.
You can disable this feature by setting the `drop` field of the node
to itself (without metadata).
To transfer the color to a special drop, you need a drop table.
Example:

    minetest.register_node("mod:stone", {
        description = "Stone",
        tiles = {"default_stone.png"},
        paramtype2 = "color",
        palette = "palette.png",
        drop = {
            items = {
                -- assume that mod:cobblestone also has the same palette
                {items = {"mod:cobblestone"}, inherit_color = true },
            }
        }
    })

### Colored items in craft recipes
Craft recipes only support item strings, but fortunately item strings
can also contain metadata. Example craft recipe registration:

    minetest.register_craft({
        output = minetest.itemstring_with_palette("wool:block", 3),
        type = "shapeless",
        recipe = {
            "wool:block",
            "dye:red",
        },
    })

To set the `color` field, you can use `minetest.itemstring_with_color`.

Metadata field filtering in the `recipe` field are not supported yet,
so the craft output is independent of the color of the ingredients.

Soft texture overlay
--------------------
Sometimes hardware coloring is not enough, because it affects the
whole tile. Soft texture overlays were added to Minetest to allow
the dynamic coloring of only specific parts of the node's texture.
For example a grass block may have colored grass, while keeping the
dirt brown.

These overlays are 'soft', because unlike texture modifiers, the layers
are not merged in the memory, but they are simply drawn on top of each
other. This allows different hardware coloring, but also means that
tiles with overlays are drawn slower. Using too much overlays might
cause FPS loss.

For inventory and wield images you can specify overlays which
hardware coloring does not modify. You have to set `inventory_overlay`
and `wield_overlay` fields to an image name.

To define a node overlay, simply set the `overlay_tiles` field of the node
definition. These tiles are defined in the same way as plain tiles:
they can have a texture name, color etc.
To skip one face, set that overlay tile to an empty string.

Example (colored grass block):

    minetest.register_node("default:dirt_with_grass", {
        description = "Dirt with Grass",
        -- Regular tiles, as usual
        -- The dirt tile disables palette coloring
        tiles = {{name = "default_grass.png"},
            {name = "default_dirt.png", color = "white"}},
        -- Overlay tiles: define them in the same style
        -- The top and bottom tile does not have overlay
        overlay_tiles = {"", "",
            {name = "default_grass_side.png", tileable_vertical = false}},
        -- Global color, used in inventory
        color = "green",
        -- Palette in the world
        paramtype2 = "color",
        palette = "default_foilage.png",
    })

Sounds
------
Only Ogg Vorbis files are supported.

For positional playing of sounds, only single-channel (mono) files are
supported. Otherwise OpenAL will play them non-positionally.

Mods should generally prefix their sounds with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name "`foomod`", a sound could be called:

    foomod_foosound.ogg

Sounds are referred to by their name with a dot, a single digit and the
file extension stripped out. When a sound is played, the actual sound file
is chosen randomly from the matching sounds.

When playing the sound `foomod_foosound`, the sound is chosen randomly
from the available ones of the following files:

* `foomod_foosound.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.0.ogg`
* `foomod_foosound.1.ogg`
* (...)
* `foomod_foosound.9.ogg`

Examples of sound parameter tables:

    -- Play locationless on all clients
    {
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        fade = 0.0, -- default, change to a value > 0 to fade the sound in
        pitch = 1.0, -- default
    }
    -- Play locationless to one player
    {
        to_player = name,
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        fade = 0.0, -- default, change to a value > 0 to fade the sound in
        pitch = 1.0, -- default
    }
    -- Play locationless to one player, looped
    {
        to_player = name,
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        loop = true,
    }
    -- Play in a location
    {
        pos = {x = 1, y = 2, z = 3},
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        max_hear_distance = 32, -- default, uses an euclidean metric
    }
    -- Play connected to an object, looped
    {
        object = <an ObjectRef>,
        gain = 1.0, -- default
        max_hear_distance = 32, -- default, uses an euclidean metric
        loop = true,
    }

Looped sounds must either be connected to an object or played locationless to
one player using `to_player = name,`

### `SimpleSoundSpec`
* e.g. `""`
* e.g. `"default_place_node"`
* e.g. `{}`
* e.g. `{name = "default_place_node"}`
* e.g. `{name = "default_place_node", gain = 1.0}`
* e.g. `{name = "default_place_node", gain = 1.0, pitch = 1.0}`

Registered definitions of stuff
-------------------------------
Anything added using certain `minetest.register_*` functions get added to
the global `minetest.registered_*` tables.

* `minetest.register_entity(name, prototype table)`
    * added to `minetest.registered_entities[name]`

* `minetest.register_node(name, node definition)`
    * added to `minetest.registered_items[name]`
    * added to `minetest.registered_nodes[name]`

* `minetest.register_tool(name, item definition)`
    * added to `minetest.registered_items[name]`

* `minetest.register_craftitem(name, item definition)`

    * clears all ores currently registered

    * clears all decorations currently registered

    * clears all schematics currently registered

Note that in some cases you will stumble upon things that are not contained
in these tables (e.g. when a mod has been removed). Always check for
existence before trying to access the fields.

Example: If you want to check the drawtype of a node, you could do:

    local function get_nodedef_field(nodename, fieldname)
        if not minetest.registered_nodes[nodename] then
            return nil
        end
        return minetest.registered_nodes[nodename][fieldname]
    end
    local drawtype = get_nodedef_field(nodename, "drawtype")

Example: `minetest.get_item_group(name, group)` has been implemented as:

    function minetest.get_item_group(name, group)
        if not minetest.registered_items[name] or not
                minetest.registered_items[name].groups[group] then
            return 0
        end
        return minetest.registered_items[name].groups[group]
    end

Nodes
-----
Nodes are the bulk data of the world: cubes and other things that take the
space of a cube. Huge amounts of them are handled efficiently, but they
are quite static.

The definition of a node is stored and can be accessed by name in

    minetest.registered_nodes[node.name]

See "Registered definitions of stuff".

Nodes are passed by value between Lua and the engine.
They are represented by a table:

    {name="name", param1=num, param2=num}

`param1` and `param2` are 8-bit integers ranging from 0 to 255. The engine uses
them for certain automated functions. If you don't use these functions, you can
use them to store arbitrary values.

The functions of `param1` and `param2` are determined by certain fields in the
node definition:

`param1` is reserved for the engine when `paramtype != "none"`:

    paramtype = "light"
    ^ The value stores light with and without sun in its upper and lower 4 bits
      respectively. Allows light to propagate from or through the node with
      light value falling by 1 per node. This is essential for a light source
      node to spread its light.

`param2` is reserved for the engine when any of these are used:

    liquidtype == "flowing"
    ^ The level and some flags of the liquid is stored in param2
    drawtype == "flowingliquid"
    ^ The drawn liquid level is read from param2
    drawtype == "torchlike"
    drawtype == "signlike"
    paramtype2 == "wallmounted"
    ^ The rotation of the node is stored in param2. You can make this value
      by using minetest.dir_to_wallmounted().
    paramtype2 == "facedir"
    ^ The rotation of the node is stored in param2. Furnaces and chests are
      rotated this way. Can be made by using minetest.dir_to_facedir().
      Values range 0 - 23
      facedir / 4 = axis direction:
      0 = y+    1 = z+    2 = z-    3 = x+    4 = x-    5 = y-
      facedir modulo 4 = rotation around that axis
    paramtype2 == "leveled"
    ^ Only valid for "nodebox" with 'type = "leveled"', and "plantlike_rooted".
      Leveled nodebox:
        The level of the top face of the nodebox is stored in param2.
        The other faces are defined by 'fixed = {}' like 'type = "fixed"' nodeboxes.
        The nodebox height is (param2 / 64) nodes.
        The maximum accepted value of param2 is 127.
      Rooted plantlike:
        The height of the 'plantlike' section is stored in param2.
        The height is (param2 / 16) nodes.
    paramtype2 == "degrotate"
    ^ The rotation of this node is stored in param2. Plants are rotated this way.
      Values range 0 - 179. The value stored in param2 is multiplied by two to
      get the actual rotation of the node.
    paramtype2 == "meshoptions"
    ^ Only valid for "plantlike". The value of param2 becomes a bitfield which can
      be used to change how the client draws plantlike nodes. Bits 0, 1 and 2 form
      a mesh selector. Currently the following meshes are choosable:
        0 = a "x" shaped plant (ordinary plant)
        1 = a "+" shaped plant (just rotated 45 degrees)
        2 = a "*" shaped plant with 3 faces instead of 2
        3 = a "#" shaped plant with 4 faces instead of 2
        4 = a "#" shaped plant with 4 faces that lean outwards
        5-7 are unused and reserved for future meshes.
      Bits 3 through 7 are optional flags that can be combined and give these
      effects:
        bit 3 (0x08) - Makes the plant slightly vary placement horizontally
        bit 4 (0x10) - Makes the plant mesh 1.4x larger
        bit 5 (0x20) - Moves each face randomly a small bit down (1/8 max)
        bits 6-7 are reserved for future use.
    paramtype2 == "color"
    ^ `param2` tells which color is picked from the palette.
      The palette should have 256 pixels.
    paramtype2 == "colorfacedir"
    ^ Same as `facedir`, but with colors.
      The first three bits of `param2` tells which color
      is picked from the palette.
      The palette should have 8 pixels.
    paramtype2 == "colorwallmounted"
    ^ Same as `wallmounted`, but with colors.
      The first five bits of `param2` tells which color
      is picked from the palette.
      The palette should have 32 pixels.
    paramtype2 == "glasslikeliquidlevel"
    ^ Only valid for "glasslike_framed" or "glasslike_framed_optional" drawtypes.
      param2 values 0-63 define 64 levels of internal liquid, 0 being empty and
      63 being full.
      Liquid texture is defined using `special_tiles = {"modname_tilename.png"},`

Nodes can also contain extra data. See "Node Metadata".

Node drawtypes
--------------
There are a bunch of different looking node types.

Look for examples in `games/minimal` or `games/minetest_game`.

* `normal`
* `airlike`
* `liquid`
* `flowingliquid`
* `glasslike`
* `glasslike_framed`
* `glasslike_framed_optional`
* `allfaces`
* `allfaces_optional`
* `torchlike`
* `signlike`
* `plantlike`
* `firelike`
* `fencelike`
* `raillike`
* `nodebox` -- See below
* `mesh` -- Use models for nodes, see below
* `plantlike_rooted` -- See below

`*_optional` drawtypes need less rendering time if deactivated (always client side).

Node boxes
----------
Node selection boxes are defined using "node boxes"

The `nodebox` node drawtype allows defining nodes consisting of an arbitrary
number of boxes. It allows defining stuff like stairs and slabs.

A nodebox is defined as any of:

    {
        -- A normal cube; the default in most things
        type = "regular"
    }
    {
        -- A fixed box (or boxes) (facedir param2 is used, if applicable)
        type = "fixed",
        fixed = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
    }
    {
        -- A variable height box (or boxes) with the top face position defined by
        -- the node parameter 'leveled = ', or if 'paramtype2 == "leveled"' by
        -- param2.
        -- Other faces are defined by 'fixed = {}' as with 'type = "fixed"'.
        type = "leveled",
        fixed = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
    }
    {
        -- A box like the selection box for torches
        -- (wallmounted param2 is used, if applicable)
        type = "wallmounted",
        wall_top = box,
        wall_bottom = box,
        wall_side = box
    }
    {
        -- A node that has optional boxes depending on neighbouring nodes'
        -- presence and type. See also `connects_to`.
        type = "connected",
        fixed = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_top = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_bottom = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_front = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_left = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_back = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
        connect_right = box OR {box1, box2, ...}
    }

A `box` is defined as:

    {x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2}

A box of a regular node would look like:

    {-0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5},

Meshes
------
If drawtype `mesh` is used, tiles should hold model materials textures.
Only static meshes are implemented.
For supported model formats see Irrlicht engine documentation.

Rooted plantlike drawtype
-------------------------
The `plantlike_rooted` drawtype was developed to enable underwater plants
without air bubbles around the plants.
It consists of a base cube at the co-ordinates of the node (the seabed /
lakebed / riverbed node) plus a 'plantlike' extension above with a height
defined by param2 (maximum height 16 nodes). This extension visually passes
through any nodes above the base cube without affecting them.
The node is dug by digging the base cube.
The base cube texture tiles are defined as normal, the plantlike extension
uses the defined 'special tile', for example:
`special_tiles = {{name = "default_papyrus.png", tileable_vertical = true}},`

Noise Parameters
----------------
Noise Parameters, or commonly called "`NoiseParams`", define the properties of
perlin noise.

### `offset`
Offset that the noise is translated by (i.e. added) after calculation.

### `scale`
Factor that the noise is scaled by (i.e. multiplied) after calculation.

### `spread`
Vector containing values by which each coordinate is divided by before calculation.
Higher spread values result in larger noise features.

A value of `{x=250, y=250, z=250}` is common.

### `seed`
Random seed for the noise. Add the world seed to a seed offset for world-unique noise.
In the case of `minetest.get_perlin()`, this value has the world seed automatically added.

### `octaves`
Number of times the noise gradient is accumulated into the noise.

Increase this number to increase the amount of detail in the resulting noise.

A value of `6` is common.

### `persistence`
Factor by which the effect of the noise gradient function changes with each successive octave.

Values less than `1` make the details of successive octaves' noise diminish, while values
greater than `1` make successive octaves stronger.

A value of `0.6` is common.

### `lacunarity`
Factor by which the noise feature sizes change with each successive octave.

A value of `2.0` is common.

### `flags`
Leave this field unset for no special handling.

Currently supported are `defaults`, `eased` and `absvalue`.

#### `defaults`
Specify this if you would like to keep auto-selection of eased/not-eased while specifying
some other flags.

#### `eased`
Maps noise gradient values onto a quintic S-curve before performing interpolation.
This results in smooth, rolling noise. Disable this (`noeased`) for sharp-looking noise.
If no flags are specified (or defaults is), 2D noise is eased and 3D noise is not eased.

#### `absvalue`
Accumulates the absolute value of each noise gradient result.

Noise parameters format example for 2D or 3D perlin noise or perlin noise maps:

    np_terrain = {
        offset = 0,
        scale = 1,
        spread = {x=500, y=500, z=500},
        seed = 571347,
        octaves = 5,
        persist = 0.63,
        lacunarity = 2.0,
        flags = "defaults, absvalue"
    }
    ^ A single noise parameter table can be used to get 2D or 3D noise,
      when getting 2D noise spread.z is ignored.


Ore types
---------
These tell in what manner the ore is generated.

All default ores are of the uniformly-distributed scatter type.

### `scatter`
Randomly chooses a location and generates a cluster of ore.

If `noise_params` is specified, the ore will be placed if the 3D perlin noise at
that point is greater than the `noise_threshold`, giving the ability to create
a non-equal distribution of ore.

### `sheet`
Creates a sheet of ore in a blob shape according to the 2D perlin noise
described by `noise_params` and `noise_threshold`. This is essentially an
improved version of the so-called "stratus" ore seen in some unofficial mods.

This sheet consists of vertical columns of uniform randomly distributed height,
varying between the inclusive range `column_height_min` and `column_height_max`.
If `column_height_min` is not specified, this parameter defaults to 1.
If `column_height_max` is not specified, this parameter defaults to `clust_size`
for reverse compatibility.  New code should prefer `column_height_max`.

The `column_midpoint_factor` parameter controls the position of the column at which
ore emanates from.  If 1, columns grow upward.  If 0, columns grow downward.  If 0.5,
columns grow equally starting from each direction.  `column_midpoint_factor` is a
decimal number ranging in value from 0 to 1.  If this parameter is not specified,
the default is 0.5.

The ore parameters `clust_scarcity` and `clust_num_ores` are ignored for this ore type.

### `puff`
Creates a sheet of ore in a cloud-like puff shape.

As with the `sheet` ore type, the size and shape of puffs are described by
`noise_params` and `noise_threshold` and are placed at random vertical positions
within the currently generated chunk.

The vertical top and bottom displacement of each puff are determined by the noise
parameters `np_puff_top` and `np_puff_bottom`, respectively.

### `blob`
Creates a deformed sphere of ore according to 3d perlin noise described by
`noise_params`.  The maximum size of the blob is `clust_size`, and
`clust_scarcity` has the same meaning as with the `scatter` type.

### `vein`
Creates veins of ore varying in density by according to the intersection of two
instances of 3d perlin noise with different seeds, both described by
`noise_params`.

`random_factor` varies the influence random chance has on placement of an ore
inside the vein, which is `1` by default. Note that modifying this parameter may
require adjusting `noise_threshold`.

The parameters `clust_scarcity`, `clust_num_ores`, and `clust_size` are ignored
by this ore type.

This ore type is difficult to control since it is sensitive to small changes.
The following is a decent set of parameters to work from:

    noise_params = {
        offset  = 0,
        scale   = 3,
        spread  = {x=200, y=200, z=200},
        seed    = 5390,
        octaves = 4,
        persist = 0.5,
        flags = "eased",
    },
    noise_threshold = 1.6

**WARNING**: Use this ore type *very* sparingly since it is ~200x more
computationally expensive than any other ore.

### `stratum`
Creates a single undulating ore stratum that is continuous across mapchunk
borders and horizontally spans the world.

The 2D perlin noise described by `noise_params` defines the Y co-ordinate of the
stratum midpoint. The 2D perlin noise described by `np_stratum_thickness`
defines the stratum's vertical thickness (in units of nodes). Due to being
continuous across mapchunk borders the stratum's vertical thickness is
unlimited.

If the noise parameter `noise_params` is omitted the ore will occur from y_min
to y_max in a simple horizontal stratum.

A parameter `stratum_thickness` can be provided instead of the noise parameter
`np_stratum_thickness`, to create a constant thickness.

Leaving out one or both noise parameters makes the ore generation less intensive,
useful when adding multiple strata.

`y_min` and `y_max` define the limits of the ore generation and for performance
reasons should be set as close together as possible but without clipping the
stratum's Y variation.

Each node in the stratum has a 1-in-`clust_scarcity` chance of being ore, so a
solid-ore stratum would require a `clust_scarcity` of 1.

The parameters `clust_num_ores`, `clust_size`, `noise_threshold` and
`random_factor` are ignored by this ore type.

Ore attributes
--------------
See section "Flag Specifier Format".

Currently supported flags:
`puff_cliffs`, `puff_additive_composition`.

### `puff_cliffs`
If set, puff ore generation will not taper down large differences in displacement
when approaching the edge of a puff.  This flag has no effect for ore types other
than `puff`.

### `puff_additive_composition`
By default, when noise described by `np_puff_top` or `np_puff_bottom` results in a
negative displacement, the sub-column at that point is not generated.  With this
attribute set, puff ore generation will instead generate the absolute difference in
noise displacement values.  This flag has no effect for ore types other than `puff`.

Decoration types
----------------
The varying types of decorations that can be placed.

### `simple`
Creates a 1 times `H` times 1 column of a specified node (or a random node from
a list, if a decoration list is specified). Can specify a certain node it must
spawn next to, such as water or lava, for example. Can also generate a
decoration of random height between a specified lower and upper bound.
This type of decoration is intended for placement of grass, flowers, cacti,
papyri, waterlilies and so on.

### `schematic`
Copies a box of `MapNodes` from a specified schematic file (or raw description).
Can specify a probability of a node randomly appearing when placed.
This decoration type is intended to be used for multi-node sized discrete
structures, such as trees, cave spikes, rocks, and so on.


Schematic specifier
--------------------
A schematic specifier identifies a schematic by either a filename to a
Minetest Schematic file (`.mts`) or through raw data supplied through Lua,
in the form of a table.  This table specifies the following fields:

* The `size` field is a 3D vector containing the dimensions of the provided schematic. (required)
* The `yslice_prob` field is a table of {ypos, prob} which sets the `ypos`th vertical slice
  of the schematic to have a `prob / 256 * 100` chance of occurring. (default: 255)
* The `data` field is a flat table of MapNode tables making up the schematic,
  in the order of `[z [y [x]]]`. (required)
  Each MapNode table contains:
  * `name`: the name of the map node to place (required)
  * `prob` (alias `param1`): the probability of this node being placed (default: 255)
  * `param2`: the raw param2 value of the node being placed onto the map (default: 0)
  * `force_place`: boolean representing if the node should forcibly overwrite any
     previous contents (default: false)

About probability values:

* A probability value of `0` or `1` means that node will never appear (0% chance).
* A probability value of `254` or `255` means the node will always appear (100% chance).
* If the probability value `p` is greater than `1`, then there is a
  `(p / 256 * 100)` percent chance that node will appear when the schematic is
  placed on the map.


Schematic attributes
--------------------
See section "Flag Specifier Format".

Currently supported flags: `place_center_x`, `place_center_y`, `place_center_z`,
                           `force_placement`.

* `place_center_x`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the X axis.
* `place_center_y`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the Y axis.
* `place_center_z`: Placement of this decoration is centered along the Z axis.
* `force_placement`: Schematic nodes other than "ignore" will replace existing nodes.


HUD element types
-----------------
The position field is used for all element types.

To account for differing resolutions, the position coordinates are the percentage
of the screen, ranging in value from `0` to `1`.

The name field is not yet used, but should contain a description of what the
HUD element represents. The direction field is the direction in which something
is drawn.

`0` draws from left to right, `1` draws from right to left, `2` draws from
top to bottom, and `3` draws from bottom to top.

The `alignment` field specifies how the item will be aligned. It ranges from `-1` to `1`,
with `0` being the center, `-1` is moved to the left/up, and `1` is to the right/down.
Fractional values can be used.

The `offset` field specifies a pixel offset from the position. Contrary to position,
the offset is not scaled to screen size. This allows for some precisely-positioned
items in the HUD.

**Note**: `offset` _will_ adapt to screen DPI as well as user defined scaling factor!

Below are the specific uses for fields in each type; fields not listed for that type are ignored.

**Note**: Future revisions to the HUD API may be incompatible; the HUD API is still
in the experimental stages.

### `image`
Displays an image on the HUD.

* `scale`: The scale of the image, with 1 being the original texture size.
  Only the X coordinate scale is used (positive values).
  Negative values represent that percentage of the screen it
  should take; e.g. `x=-100` means 100% (width).
* `text`: The name of the texture that is displayed.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the image.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `text`
Displays text on the HUD.

* `scale`: Defines the bounding rectangle of the text.
  A value such as `{x=100, y=100}` should work.
* `text`: The text to be displayed in the HUD element.
* `number`: An integer containing the RGB value of the color used to draw the text.
  Specify `0xFFFFFF` for white text, `0xFF0000` for red, and so on.
* `alignment`: The alignment of the text.
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `statbar`
Displays a horizontal bar made up of half-images.

* `text`: The name of the texture that is used.
* `number`: The number of half-textures that are displayed.
  If odd, will end with a vertically center-split texture.
* `direction`
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.
* `size`: If used, will force full-image size to this value (override texture pack image size)

### `inventory`
* `text`: The name of the inventory list to be displayed.
* `number`: Number of items in the inventory to be displayed.
* `item`: Position of item that is selected.
* `direction`
* `offset`: offset in pixels from position.

### `waypoint`
Displays distance to selected world position.

* `name`: The name of the waypoint.
* `text`: Distance suffix. Can be blank.
* `number:` An integer containing the RGB value of the color used to draw the text.
* `world_pos`: World position of the waypoint.

Representations of simple things
--------------------------------

### Position/vector

    {x=num, y=num, z=num}

For helper functions see "Vector helpers".

### `pointed_thing`
* `{type="nothing"}`
* `{type="node", under=pos, above=pos}`
* `{type="object", ref=ObjectRef}`

Flag Specifier Format
---------------------
Flags using the standardized flag specifier format can be specified in either of
two ways, by string or table.

The string format is a comma-delimited set of flag names; whitespace and
unrecognized flag fields are ignored. Specifying a flag in the string sets the
flag, and specifying a flag prefixed by the string `"no"` explicitly
clears the flag from whatever the default may be.

In addition to the standard string flag format, the schematic flags field can
also be a table of flag names to boolean values representing whether or not the
flag is set. Additionally, if a field with the flag name prefixed with `"no"`
is present, mapped to a boolean of any value, the specified flag is unset.

E.g. A flag field of value

    {place_center_x = true, place_center_y=false, place_center_z=true}

is equivalent to

    {place_center_x = true, noplace_center_y=true, place_center_z=true}

which is equivalent to

    "place_center_x, noplace_center_y, place_center_z"

or even

    "place_center_x, place_center_z"

since, by default, no schematic attributes are set.

Items
-----

### Item types
There are three kinds of items: nodes, tools and craftitems.

* Node (`register_node`): A node from the world.
* Tool (`register_tool`): A tool/weapon that can dig and damage
  things according to `tool_capabilities`.
* Craftitem (`register_craftitem`): A miscellaneous item.

### Amount and wear
All item stacks have an amount between 0 to 65535. It is 1 by
default. Tool item stacks can not have an amount greater than 1.

Tools use a wear (=damage) value ranging from 0 to 65535. The
value 0 is the default and used is for unworn tools. The values
1 to 65535 are used for worn tools, where a higher value stands for
a higher wear. Non-tools always have a wear value of 0.

### Item formats
Items and item stacks can exist in three formats: Serializes, table format
and `ItemStack`.

#### Serialized
This is called "stackstring" or "itemstring". It is a simple string with
1-3 components: the full item identifier, an optional amount and an optional
wear value. Syntax:

    <identifier> [<amount>[ <wear>]]

Examples:

* `'default:apple'`: 1 apple
* `'default:dirt 5'`: 5 dirt
* `'default:pick_stone'`: a new stone pickaxe
* `'default:pick_wood 1 21323'`: a wooden pickaxe, ca. 1/3 worn out

#### Table format
Examples:

5 dirt nodes:

    {name="default:dirt", count=5, wear=0, metadata=""}

A wooden pick about 1/3 worn out:

    {name="default:pick_wood", count=1, wear=21323, metadata=""}

An apple:

    {name="default:apple", count=1, wear=0, metadata=""}

#### `ItemStack`
A native C++ format with many helper methods. Useful for converting
between formats. See the Class reference section for details.

When an item must be passed to a function, it can usually be in any of
these formats.


Groups
------
In a number of places, there is a group table. Groups define the
properties of a thing (item, node, armor of entity, capabilities of
tool) in such a way that the engine and other mods can can interact with
the thing without actually knowing what the thing is.

### Usage
Groups are stored in a table, having the group names with keys and the
group ratings as values. For example:

    groups = {crumbly=3, soil=1}
    -- ^ Default dirt

    groups = {crumbly=2, soil=1, level=2, outerspace=1}
    -- ^ A more special dirt-kind of thing

Groups always have a rating associated with them. If there is no
useful meaning for a rating for an enabled group, it shall be `1`.

When not defined, the rating of a group defaults to `0`. Thus when you
read groups, you must interpret `nil` and `0` as the same value, `0`.

You can read the rating of a group for an item or a node by using

    minetest.get_item_group(itemname, groupname)

### Groups of items
Groups of items can define what kind of an item it is (e.g. wool).

### Groups of nodes
In addition to the general item things, groups are used to define whether
a node is destroyable and how long it takes to destroy by a tool.

### Groups of entities
For entities, groups are, as of now, used only for calculating damage.
The rating is the percentage of damage caused by tools with this damage group.
See "Entity damage mechanism".

    object.get_armor_groups() --> a group-rating table (e.g. {fleshy=100})
    object.set_armor_groups({fleshy=30, cracky=80})

### Groups of tools
Groups in tools define which groups of nodes and entities they are
effective towards.

### Groups in crafting recipes
An example: Make meat soup from any meat, any water and any bowl:

    {
        output = 'food:meat_soup_raw',
        recipe = {
            {'group:meat'},
            {'group:water'},
            {'group:bowl'},
        },
        -- preserve = {'group:bowl'}, -- Not implemented yet (TODO)
    }

Another example: Make red wool from white wool and red dye:

    {
        type = 'shapeless',
        output = 'wool:red',
        recipe = {'wool:white', 'group:dye,basecolor_red'},
    }

### Special groups
* `immortal`: Disables the group damage system for an entity
* `punch_operable`: For entities; disables the regular damage mechanism for
  players punching it by hand or a non-tool item, so that it can do something
  else than take damage.
* `level`: Can be used to give an additional sense of progression in the game.
     * A larger level will cause e.g. a weapon of a lower level make much less
       damage, and get worn out much faster, or not be able to get drops
       from destroyed nodes.
     * `0` is something that is directly accessible at the start of gameplay
     * There is no upper limit
* `dig_immediate`: (player can always pick up node without reducing tool wear)
    * `2`: the node always gets the digging time 0.5 seconds (rail, sign)
    * `3`: the node always gets the digging time 0 seconds (torch)
* `disable_jump`: Player (and possibly other things) cannot jump from node
* `fall_damage_add_percent`: damage speed = `speed * (1 + value/100)`
* `bouncy`: value is bounce speed in percent
* `falling_node`: if there is no walkable block under the node it will fall
* `attached_node`: if the node under it is not a walkable block the node will be
  dropped as an item. If the node is wallmounted the wallmounted direction is
  checked.
* `soil`: saplings will grow on nodes in this group
* `connect_to_raillike`: makes nodes of raillike drawtype with same group value
  connect to each other
* `slippery`: Players and items will slide on the node.
  Slipperiness rises steadily with `slippery` value, starting at 1.


### Known damage and digging time defining groups
* `crumbly`: dirt, sand
* `cracky`: tough but crackable stuff like stone.
* `snappy`: something that can be cut using fine tools; e.g. leaves, small
  plants, wire, sheets of metal
* `choppy`: something that can be cut using force; e.g. trees, wooden planks
* `fleshy`: Living things like animals and the player. This could imply
  some blood effects when hitting.
* `explody`: Especially prone to explosions
* `oddly_breakable_by_hand`:
   Can be added to nodes that shouldn't logically be breakable by the
   hand but are. Somewhat similar to `dig_immediate`, but times are more
   like `{[1]=3.50,[2]=2.00,[3]=0.70}` and this does not override the
   speed of a tool if the tool can dig at a faster speed than this
   suggests for the hand.

### Examples of custom groups
Item groups are often used for defining, well, _groups of items_.

* `meat`: any meat-kind of a thing (rating might define the size or healing
  ability or be irrelevant -- it is not defined as of yet)
* `eatable`: anything that can be eaten. Rating might define HP gain in half
  hearts.
* `flammable`: can be set on fire. Rating might define the intensity of the
  fire, affecting e.g. the speed of the spreading of an open fire.
* `wool`: any wool (any origin, any color)
* `metal`: any metal
* `weapon`: any weapon
* `heavy`: anything considerably heavy

### Digging time calculation specifics
Groups such as `crumbly`, `cracky` and `snappy` are used for this
purpose. Rating is `1`, `2` or `3`. A higher rating for such a group implies
faster digging time.

The `level` group is used to limit the toughness of nodes a tool can dig
and to scale the digging times / damage to a greater extent.

**Please do understand this**, otherwise you cannot use the system to it's
full potential.

Tools define their properties by a list of parameters for groups. They
cannot dig other groups; thus it is important to use a standard bunch of
groups to enable interaction with tools.

#### Tools definition
Tools define:

* Full punch interval
* Maximum drop level
* For an arbitrary list of groups:
    * Uses (until the tool breaks)
        * Maximum level (usually `0`, `1`, `2` or `3`)
        * Digging times
        * Damage groups

#### Full punch interval
When used as a weapon, the tool will do full damage if this time is spent
between punches. If e.g. half the time is spent, the tool will do half
damage.

#### Maximum drop level
Suggests the maximum level of node, when dug with the tool, that will drop
it's useful item. (e.g. iron ore to drop a lump of iron).

This is not automated; it is the responsibility of the node definition
to implement this.

#### Uses
Determines how many uses the tool has when it is used for digging a node,
of this group, of the maximum level. For lower leveled nodes, the use count
is multiplied by `3^leveldiff`.

* `uses=10, leveldiff=0`: actual uses: 10
* `uses=10, leveldiff=1`: actual uses: 30
* `uses=10, leveldiff=2`: actual uses: 90

#### Maximum level
Tells what is the maximum level of a node of this group that the tool will
be able to dig.

#### Digging times
List of digging times for different ratings of the group, for nodes of the
maximum level.

For example, as a Lua table, `times={2=2.00, 3=0.70}`. This would
result in the tool to be able to dig nodes that have a rating of `2` or `3`
for this group, and unable to dig the rating `1`, which is the toughest.
Unless there is a matching group that enables digging otherwise.

If the result digging time is 0, a delay of 0.15 seconds is added between
digging nodes; If the player releases LMB after digging, this delay is set to 0,
i.e. players can more quickly click the nodes away instead of holding LMB.

#### Damage groups
List of damage for groups of entities. See "Entity damage mechanism".

#### Example definition of the capabilities of a tool

    tool_capabilities = {
        full_punch_interval=1.5,
        max_drop_level=1,
        groupcaps={
            crumbly={maxlevel=2, uses=20, times={[1]=1.60, [2]=1.20, [3]=0.80}}
        }
        damage_groups = {fleshy=2},
    }

This makes the tool be able to dig nodes that fulfil both of these:

* Have the `crumbly` group
* Have a `level` group less or equal to `2`

Table of resulting digging times:

    crumbly        0     1     2     3     4  <- level
         ->  0     -     -     -     -     -
             1  0.80  1.60  1.60     -     -
             2  0.60  1.20  1.20     -     -
             3  0.40  0.80  0.80     -     -

    level diff:    2     1     0    -1    -2

Table of resulting tool uses:

    ->  0     -     -     -     -     -
        1   180    60    20     -     -
        2   180    60    20     -     -
        3   180    60    20     -     -

**Notes**:

* At `crumbly==0`, the node is not diggable.
* At `crumbly==3`, the level difference digging time divider kicks in and makes
  easy nodes to be quickly breakable.
* At `level > 2`, the node is not diggable, because it's `level > maxlevel`

Entity damage mechanism
-----------------------
Damage calculation:

    damage = 0
    foreach group in cap.damage_groups:
        damage += cap.damage_groups[group] * limit(actual_interval /
               cap.full_punch_interval, 0.0, 1.0)
            * (object.armor_groups[group] / 100.0)
            -- Where object.armor_groups[group] is 0 for inexistent values
    return damage

Client predicts damage based on damage groups. Because of this, it is able to
give an immediate response when an entity is damaged or dies; the response is
pre-defined somehow (e.g. by defining a sprite animation) (not implemented;
TODO).
Currently a smoke puff will appear when an entity dies.

The group `immortal` completely disables normal damage.

Entities can define a special armor group, which is `punch_operable`. This
group disables the regular damage mechanism for players punching it by hand or
a non-tool item, so that it can do something else than take damage.

On the Lua side, every punch calls:

    entity:on_punch(puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction, damage)

This should never be called directly, because damage is usually not handled by
the entity itself.

* `puncher` is the object performing the punch. Can be `nil`. Should never be
  accessed unless absolutely required, to encourage interoperability.
* `time_from_last_punch` is time from last punch (by `puncher`) or `nil`.
* `tool_capabilities` can be `nil`.
* `direction` is a unit vector, pointing from the source of the punch to
   the punched object.
* `damage` damage that will be done to entity
Return value of this function will determine if damage is done by this function
(retval true) or shall be done by engine (retval false)

To punch an entity/object in Lua, call:

    object:punch(puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction)

* Return value is tool wear.
* Parameters are equal to the above callback.
* If `direction` equals `nil` and `puncher` does not equal `nil`,
  `direction` will be automatically filled in based on the location of `puncher`.

Node Metadata
-------------
The instance of a node in the world normally only contains the three values
mentioned in "Nodes". However, it is possible to insert extra data into a
node. It is called "node metadata"; See `NodeMetaRef`.

Node metadata contains two things:

* A key-value store
* An inventory

Some of the values in the key-value store are handled specially:

* `formspec`: Defines a right-click inventory menu. See "Formspec".
* `infotext`: Text shown on the screen when the node is pointed at

Example stuff:

    local meta = minetest.get_meta(pos)
    meta:set_string("formspec",
            "size[8,9]"..
            "list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]"..
            "list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]")
    meta:set_string("infotext", "Chest");
    local inv = meta:get_inventory()
    inv:set_size("main", 8*4)
    print(dump(meta:to_table()))
    meta:from_table({
        inventory = {
            main = {[1] = "default:dirt", [2] = "", [3] = "", [4] = "",
                    [5] = "", [6] = "", [7] = "", [8] = "", [9] = "",
                    [10] = "", [11] = "", [12] = "", [13] = "",
                    [14] = "default:cobble", [15] = "", [16] = "", [17] = "",
                    [18] = "", [19] = "", [20] = "default:cobble", [21] = "",
                    [22] = "", [23] = "", [24] = "", [25] = "", [26] = "",
                    [27] = "", [28] = "", [29] = "", [30] = "", [31] = "",
                    [32] = ""}
        },
        fields = {
            formspec = "size[8,9]list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]",
            infotext = "Chest"
        }
    })

Item Metadata
-------------
Item stacks can store metadata too. See `ItemStackMetaRef`.

Item metadata only contains a key-value store.

Some of the values in the key-value store are handled specially:

* `description`: Set the item stack's description. Defaults to `idef.description`
* `color`: A `ColorString`, which sets the stack's color.
* `palette_index`: If the item has a palette, this is used to get the
                  current color from the palette.

Example stuff:

    local meta = stack:get_meta()
    meta:set_string("key", "value")
    print(dump(meta:to_table()))

Formspec
--------
Formspec defines a menu. Currently not much else than inventories are
supported. It is a string, with a somewhat strange format.

Spaces and newlines can be inserted between the blocks, as is used in the
examples.

### Examples

#### Chest

    size[8,9]
    list[context;main;0,0;8,4;]

    list[current_player;main;0,5;8,4;]

#### Minecraft-like player inventory

    size[8,7.5]
    image[1,0.6;1,2;player.png]
    list[current_player;main;0,3.5;8,4;]

Inventory locations
-------------------
* `"context"`: Selected node metadata (deprecated: `"current_name"`)
* `"current_player"`: Player to whom the menu is shown
* `"player:<name>"`: Any player
* `"nodemeta:<X>,<Y>,<Z>"`: Any node metadata
* `"detached:<name>"`: A detached inventory

Player Inventory lists
----------------------
* `main`: list containing the default inventory
* `craft`: list containing the craft input
* `craftpreview`: list containing the craft output
* `hand`: list containing an override for the empty hand

`ColorString`
-------------
`#RGB` defines a color in hexadecimal format.

`#RGBA` defines a color in hexadecimal format and alpha channel.

`#RRGGBB` defines a color in hexadecimal format.

`#RRGGBBAA` defines a color in hexadecimal format and alpha channel.

Named colors are also supported and are equivalent to
[CSS Color Module Level 4](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#named-colors).
To specify the value of the alpha channel, append `#AA` to the end of the color name
(e.g. `colorname#08`). For named colors the hexadecimal string representing the alpha
value must (always) be two hexadecimal digits.

`ColorSpec`
-----------
A ColorSpec specifies a 32-bit color.  It can be written in either:
table form, each element ranging from 0..255 (a, if absent, defaults to 255):
    `colorspec = {a=255, r=0, g=255, b=0}`
numerical form, the raw integer value of an ARGB8 quad:
    `colorspec = 0xFF00FF00`
or string form, a ColorString (defined above):
    `colorspec = "green"`

Escape sequences
----------------
Most text can contain escape sequences, that can for example color the text.
There are a few exceptions: tab headers, dropdowns and vertical labels can't.
The following functions provide escape sequences:

* `minetest.get_color_escape_sequence(color)`:
    * `color` is a ColorString
    * The escape sequence sets the text color to `color`
* `minetest.colorize(color, message)`:
    * Equivalent to:
      `minetest.get_color_escape_sequence(color) ..
       message ..
       minetest.get_color_escape_sequence("#ffffff")`
* `minetest.get_background_escape_sequence(color)`
    * `color` is a ColorString
    * The escape sequence sets the background of the whole text element to
      `color`. Only defined for item descriptions and tooltips.
* `minetest.strip_foreground_colors(str)`
    * Removes foreground colors added by `get_color_escape_sequence`.
* `minetest.strip_background_colors(str)`
    * Removes background colors added by `get_background_escape_sequence`.

Translations
------------

Texts can be translated client-side with the help of `minetest.translate` and translation files.

### Translating a string
Two functions are provided to translate strings: `minetest.translate` and `minetest.get_translator`.

* `minetest.get_translator(textdomain)` is a simple wrapper around `minetest.translate`, and
  `minetest.get_translator(textdomain)(str, ...)` is equivalent to `minetest.translate(textdomain, str, ...)`.
  It is intended to be used in the following way, so that it avoids verbose repetitions of `minetest.translate`:

    local S = minetest.get_translator(textdomain)
    S(str, ...)

  As an extra commodity, if `textdomain` is nil, it is assumed to be "" instead.

* `minetest.translate(textdomain, str, ...)` translates the string `str` with the given `textdomain`
  for disambiguation. The textdomain must match the textdomain specified in the translation file in order
  to get the string translated. This can be used so that a string is translated differently in different contexts.
  It is advised to use the name of the mod as textdomain whenever possible, to avoid clashes with other mods.
  This function must be given a number of arguments equal to the number of arguments the translated string expects.
  Arguments are literal strings -- they will not be translated, so if you want them to be, they need to come as
  outputs of `minetest.translate` as well.

  For instance, suppose we want to translate "@1 Wool" with "@1" being replaced by the translation of "Red".
  We can do the following:

    local S = minetest.get_translator()
    S("@1 Wool", S("Red"))

  This will be displayed as "Red Wool" on old clients and on clients that do not have localization enabled.
  However, if we have for instance a translation file named `wool.fr.tr` containing the following:

    @1 Wool=Laine @1
    Red=Rouge

  this will be displayed as "Laine Rouge" on clients with a French locale.

### Operations on translated strings

The output of `minetest.translate` is a string, with escape sequences adding additional information to that string
so that it can be translated on the different clients. In particular, you can't expect operations like string.length
to work on them like you would expect them to, or string.gsub to work in the expected manner. However, string
concatenation will still work as expected (note that you should only use this for things like formspecs; do not
translate sentences by breaking them into parts; arguments should be used instead), and operations such as
`minetest.colorize` which are only concatenation under the hood as well.

### Translation file format
A translation file has the suffix `.[lang].tr`, where `[lang]` is the language it corresponds to.
The file should be a text file, with the following format:

* Lines beginning with `# textdomain:` (the space is significant) can be used to specify the text
  domain of all following translations in the file.
* All other empty lines or lines beginning with `#` are ignored.
* Other lines should be in the format `original=translated`. Both `original` and `translated` can
  contain escape sequences beginning with `@` to insert arguments, literal `@`, `=` or newline
  (See ### Escapes below). There must be no extraneous whitespace around the `=` or at the beginning
  or the end of the line.

### Escapes
Strings that need to be translated can contain several escapes, preceded by `@`.
* `@@` acts as a literal `@`.
* `@n`, where `n` is a digit between 1 and 9, is an argument for the translated string that will be inlined
  when translation. Due to how translations are implemented, the original translation string **must** have
  its arguments in increasing order, without gaps or repetitions, starting from 1.
* `@=` acts as a literal `=`. It is not required in strings given to `minetest.translate`, but is in translation
  files to avoid being confused with the `=` separating the original from the translation.
* `@\n` (where the `\n` is a literal newline) acts as a literal newline. As with `@=`, this escape is not required
  in strings given to `minetest.translate`, but is in translation files.
* `@n` acts as a literal newline as well.

  Use this for informational purposes only. The information in the returned
  table does not represent the capabilities of the engine, nor is it
  reliable or verifiable. Compatible forks will have a different name and

    * **Warning**: If the server terminates abnormally (i.e. crashes), the registered
      callbacks **will likely not be run**. Data should be saved at
      semi-frequent intervals as well as on server shutdown.
* `minetest.register_on_placenode(func(pos, newnode, placer, oldnode, itemstack, pointed_thing))`
    * Called when a node has been placed
    * If return `true` no item is taken from `itemstack`
    * `placer` may be any valid ObjectRef or nil.

* `minetest.check_password_entry(name, entry, password)`
    * Returns true if the "password entry" for a player with name matches given
      password, false otherwise.
    * The "password entry" is the password representation generated by the engine
      as returned as part of a `get_auth()` call on the auth handler.
    * Only use this function for making it possible to log in via password from
      external protocols such as IRC, other uses are frowned upon.
* `minetest.get_password_hash(name, raw_password)`
    * Convert a name-password pair to a password hash that Minetest can use.
    * The returned value alone is not a good basis for password checks based
      on comparing the password hash in the database with the password hash
      from the function, with an externally provided password, as the hash
      in the db might use the new SRP verifier format.
    * For this purpose, use `minetest.check_password_entry` instead.

* `minetest.notify_authentication_modified(name)`
    * Must be called by the authentication handler for privilege changes.

              node being modified,
            * `prob` is an integer value from `0` to `255` that encodes probability and
              per-node force-place. Probability has levels 0-127, then 128 is added to
              encode per-node force-place.
              For probability stated as 0-255, divide by 2 and round down to get values
              0-127, then add 128 to apply per-node force-place.
            * If there are two or more entries with the same pos value, the
              last entry is used.
            * If `pos` is not inside the box formed by `p1` and `p2`, it is ignored.
            * If `probability_list` equals `nil`, no probabilities are applied.
    * Apply the specified probability to the specified horizontal slices according to the
      `slice_prob_list`.
        * `slice_prob_list` is an array of tables containing two fields, `ypos` and `prob`.
            * `ypos` indicates the y position of the slice with a probability applied,
              the lowest slice being `ypos = 0`.
            * If slice probability list equals `nil`, no slice probabilities are applied.
    * Saves schematic in the Minetest Schematic format to filename.

* `minetest.place_schematic(pos, schematic, rotation, replacements, force_placement)`
    * Place the schematic specified by schematic (see: Schematic specifier) at `pos`.

    * `replacements` = `{["old_name"] = "convert_to", ...}`
    * `force_placement` is a boolean indicating whether nodes other than `air` and
      `ignore` are replaced by the schematic
    * Returns nil if the schematic could not be loaded.

* `minetest.place_schematic_on_vmanip(vmanip, pos, schematic, rotation, replacement, force_placement)`:
    * This function is analogous to minetest.place_schematic, but places a schematic onto the
      specified VoxelManip object `vmanip` instead of the whole map.
    * Returns false if any part of the schematic was cut-off due to the VoxelManip not
      containing the full area required, and true if the whole schematic was able to fit.
    * Returns nil if the schematic could not be loaded.

* `minetest.serialize_schematic(schematic, format, options)`
    * Return the serialized schematic specified by schematic (see: Schematic specifier)
    * in the `format` of either "mts" or "lua".
    * "mts" - a string containing the binary MTS data used in the MTS file format
    * "lua" - a string containing Lua code representing the schematic in table format
    * `options` is a table containing the following optional parameters:
    * If `lua_use_comments` is true and `format` is "lua", the Lua code generated will have (X, Z)
    * position comments for every X row generated in the schematic data for easier reading.
    * If `lua_num_indent_spaces` is a nonzero number and `format` is "lua", the Lua code generated
    * will use that number of spaces as indentation instead of a tab character.

### HTTP Requests:
* `minetest.request_http_api()`:
    * returns `HTTPApiTable` containing http functions if the calling mod has been granted
      access by being listed in the `secure.http_mods` or `secure.trusted_mods` setting,

    * The returned table contains the functions `fetch`, `fetch_async` and `fetch_async_get`
      described below.
    * Only works at init time and must be called from the mod's main scope (not from a function).
    * Function only exists if minetest server was built with cURL support.

    * On success returns a table, a string, a number, a boolean or `nullvalue`
    * On failure outputs an error message and returns `nil`
    * Example: `parse_json("[10, {\"a\":false}]")`, returns `{10, {a = false}}`
* `minetest.write_json(data[, styled])`: returns a string or `nil` and an error message
    * Convert a Lua table into a JSON string
    * styled: Outputs in a human-readable format if this is set, defaults to false
    * Unserializable things like functions and userdata will cause an error.
    * **Warning**: JSON is more strict than the Lua table format.
        1. You can only use strings and positive integers of at least one as keys.
        2. You can not mix string and integer keys.
           This is due to the fact that JSON has two distinct array and object values.
    * Example: `write_json({10, {a = false}})`, returns `"[10, {\"a\": false}]"`
* `minetest.serialize(table)`: returns a string
    * Convert a table containing tables, strings, numbers, booleans and `nil`s

      Returns false or nil, if the player is allowed to do such actions.
    * `name` will be "" for non-players or unknown players.
    * This function should be overridden by protection mods and should be used to
      check if a player can interact at a position.
    * This function should call the old version of itself if the position is not
      protected by the mod.
    * Example:

            local old_is_protected = minetest.is_protected
            function minetest.is_protected(pos, name)
                if mymod:position_protected_from(pos, name) then

      field is false or omitted (else, the itemstack is not changed). `orient_flags`
      is an optional table containing extra tweaks to the placement code:
        * `invert_wall`:   if `true`, place wall-orientation on the ground and ground-
    orientation on the wall.
        * `force_wall` :   if `true`, always place the node in wall orientation.
        * `force_ceiling`: if `true`, always place on the ceiling.
        * `force_floor`:   if `true`, always place the node on the floor.
        * `force_facedir`: if `true`, forcefully reset the facedir to north when placing on
          the floor or ceiling
        * The first four options are mutually-exclusive; the last in the list takes
          precedence over the first.
* `minetest.rotate_node(itemstack, placer, pointed_thing)`
    * calls `rotate_and_place()` with infinitestacks set according to the state of

### ModChannel

An interface to use mod channels on client and server

#### Methods
* `leave()`: leave the mod channel.
    * Server leaves channel `channel_name`.
    * No more incoming or outgoing messages can be sent to this channel from server mods.
    * This invalidate all future object usage
    * Ensure your set mod_channel to nil after that to free Lua resources
* `is_writeable()`: returns true if channel is writeable and mod can send over it.
* `send_all(message)`: Send `message` though the mod channel.
    * If mod channel is not writeable or invalid, message will be dropped.
    * Message size is limited to 65535 characters by protocol.

### `MetaDataRef`
See `StorageRef`, `NodeMetaRef` and `ItemStackMetaRef`.

#### Methods
* `set_string(name, value)`
* `get_string(name)`
* `set_int(name, value)`
* `get_int(name)`
* `set_float(name, value)`
* `get_float(name)`
* `to_table()`: returns `nil` or a table with keys:
    * `fields`: key-value storage
    * `inventory`: `{list1 = {}, ...}}` (NodeMetaRef only)
* `from_table(nil or {})`
    * Any non-table value will clear the metadata
    * See "Node Metadata" for an example
    * returns `true` on success
* `equals(other)`
    * returns `true` if this metadata has the same key-value pairs as `other`

### `NodeMetaRef`
Node metadata: reference extra data and functionality stored in a node.
Can be obtained via `minetest.get_meta(pos)`.

#### Methods
* All methods in MetaDataRef
* `get_inventory()`: returns `InvRef`
* `mark_as_private(name or {name1, name2, ...})`: Mark specific vars as private
  This will prevent them from being sent to the client. Note that the "private"
  status will only be remembered if an associated key-value pair exists, meaning
  it's best to call this when initializing all other meta (e.g. `on_construct`).

### `ItemStackMetaRef`
ItemStack metadata: reference extra data and functionality stored in a stack.
Can be obtained via `item:get_meta()`.

#### Methods
* All methods in MetaDataRef
* `set_tool_capabilities([tool_capabilities])`
    * overrides the item's tool capabilities
    * a nil value will clear the override data and restore the original behavior

### `StorageRef`
Mod metadata: per mod metadata, saved automatically.
Can be obtained via `minetest.get_mod_storage()` during load time.

#### Methods
* All methods in MetaDataRef

### `NodeTimerRef`
Node Timers: a high resolution persistent per-node timer.
Can be gotten via `minetest.get_node_timer(pos)`.

#### Methods
* `set(timeout,elapsed)`
    * set a timer's state
    * `timeout` is in seconds, and supports fractional values (0.1 etc)
    * `elapsed` is in seconds, and supports fractional values (0.1 etc)
    * will trigger the node's `on_timer` function after `(timeout - elapsed)` seconds
* `start(timeout)`
    * start a timer
    * equivalent to `set(timeout,0)`
* `stop()`
    * stops the timer
* `get_timeout()`: returns current timeout in seconds
    * if `timeout` equals `0`, timer is inactive
* `get_elapsed()`: returns current elapsed time in seconds
    * the node's `on_timer` function will be called after `(timeout - elapsed)` seconds

### `AreaStore`
A fast access data structure to store areas, and find areas near a given position or area.
Every area has a `data` string attribute to store additional information.
You can create an empty `AreaStore` by calling `AreaStore()`, or `AreaStore(type_name)`.
If you chose the parameter-less constructor, a fast implementation will be automatically
chosen for you.

#### Methods
* `get_area(id, include_borders, include_data)`: returns the area with the id `id`.
  (optional) Boolean values `include_borders` and `include_data` control what's copied.
  Returns nil if specified area id does not exist.
* `get_areas_for_pos(pos, include_borders, include_data)`: returns all areas that contain
  the position `pos`. (optional) Boolean values `include_borders` and `include_data` control
  what's copied.
* `get_areas_in_area(edge1, edge2, accept_overlap, include_borders, include_data)`:
  returns all areas that contain all nodes inside the area specified by `edge1` and `edge2` (inclusive).
  If `accept_overlap` is true, also areas are returned that have nodes in common with the specified area.
  (optional) Boolean values `include_borders` and `include_data` control what's copied.
* `insert_area(edge1, edge2, data, [id])`: inserts an area into the store. Returns the new area's ID,
  or nil if the insertion failed. The (inclusive) positions `edge1` and `edge2` describe the area.
  `data` is a string stored with the area.  If passed, `id` will be used as the internal area ID,
  it must be a unique number between 0 and 2^32-2. If you use the `id` parameter you must always use it,
  or insertions are likely to fail due to conflicts.
* `reserve(count)`: reserves resources for at most `count` many contained areas.
  Only needed for efficiency, and only some implementations profit.
* `remove_area(id)`: removes the area with the given id from the store, returns success.
* `set_cache_params(params)`: sets params for the included prefiltering cache.
  Calling invalidates the cache, so that its elements have to be newly generated.
    * `params`:
      {
        enabled = boolean, -- whether to enable, default true
        block_radius = number, -- the radius (in nodes) of the areas the cache generates
                                  prefiltered lists for, minimum 16, default 64
        limit = number, -- the cache's size, minimum 20, default 1000
      }
* `to_string()`: Experimental. Returns area store serialized as a (binary) string.
* `to_file(filename)`: Experimental. Like `to_string()`, but writes the data to a file.
* `from_string(str)`: Experimental. Deserializes string and loads it into the AreaStore.
  Returns success and, optionally, an error message.
* `from_file(filename)`: Experimental. Like `from_string()`, but reads the data from a file.

* `next(min, max)`: return next integer random number [`min`...`max`]
    * `((max - min) == 32767) or ((max-min) <= 6553))` must be true
      due to the simple implementation making bad distribution otherwise.

### `PcgRandom`

    *   `mean = (max - min) / 2`, and
    *   `variance = (((max - min + 1) ^ 2) - 1) / (12 * num_trials)`
    * Increasing `num_trials` improves accuracy of the approximation

* `get3d(pos)`: returns 3D noise value at `pos={x=,y=,z=}`

### `PerlinNoiseMap`
A fast, bulk perlin noise generator.

It can be created via `PerlinNoiseMap(noiseparams, size)` or
`minetest.get_perlin_map(noiseparams, size)`.

Format of `size` is `{x=dimx, y=dimy, z=dimz}`.  The `z` component is omitted
for 2D noise, and it must be must be larger than 1 for 3D noise (otherwise
`nil` is returned).

For each of the functions with an optional `buffer` parameter:  If `buffer` is not
nil, this table will be used to store the result instead of creating a new table.


#### Methods
* `get2dMap(pos)`: returns a `<size.x>` times `<size.y>` 2D array of 2D noise
  with values starting at `pos={x=,y=}`
* `get3dMap(pos)`: returns a `<size.x>` times `<size.y>` times `<size.z>` 3D array
  of 3D noise with values starting at `pos={x=,y=,z=}`
* `get2dMap_flat(pos, buffer)`: returns a flat `<size.x * size.y>` element array of 2D noise
  with values starting at `pos={x=,y=}`
* `get3dMap_flat(pos, buffer)`: Same as `get2dMap_flat`, but 3D noise
* `calc2dMap(pos)`: Calculates the 2d noise map starting at `pos`.  The result is stored internally.
* `calc3dMap(pos)`: Calculates the 3d noise map starting at `pos`.  The result is stored internally.
* `getMapSlice(slice_offset, slice_size, buffer)`: In the form of an array, returns a slice of the
  most recently computed noise results.  The result slice begins at coordinates `slice_offset` and
  takes a chunk of `slice_size`.
  E.g. to grab a 2-slice high horizontal 2d plane of noise starting at buffer offset y = 20:
  `noisevals = noise:getMapSlice({y=20}, {y=2})`
  It is important to note that `slice_offset` offset coordinates begin at 1, and are relative to
  the starting position of the most recently calculated noise.
  To grab a single vertical column of noise starting at map coordinates x = 1023, y=1000, z = 1000:
  `noise:calc3dMap({x=1000, y=1000, z=1000})`
  `noisevals = noise:getMapSlice({x=24, z=1}, {x=1, z=1})`

### `VoxelManip`

#### About VoxelManip
VoxelManip is a scripting interface to the internal 'Map Voxel Manipulator' facility.  The purpose of
this object is for fast, low-level, bulk access to reading and writing Map content.  As such, setting
map nodes through VoxelManip will lack many of the higher level features and concepts you may be used
to with other methods of setting nodes.  For example, nodes will not have their construction and
destruction callbacks run, and no rollback information is logged.

It is important to note that VoxelManip is designed for speed, and *not* ease of use or flexibility.
If your mod requires a map manipulation facility that will handle 100% of all edge cases, or the use
of high level node placement features, perhaps `minetest.set_node()` is better suited for the job.

In addition, VoxelManip might not be faster, or could even be slower, for your specific use case.
VoxelManip is most effective when setting very large areas of map at once - for example, if only
setting a 5x5x5 node area, a `minetest.set_node()` loop may be more optimal.  Always profile code
using both methods of map manipulation to determine which is most appropriate for your usage.

#### Using VoxelManip
A VoxelManip object can be created any time using either:
`VoxelManip([p1, p2])`, or `minetest.get_voxel_manip([p1, p2])`.

If the optional position parameters are present for either of these routines, the specified region
will be pre-loaded into the VoxelManip object on creation.  Otherwise, the area of map you wish to
manipulate must first be loaded into the VoxelManip object using `VoxelManip:read_from_map()`.

Note that `VoxelManip:read_from_map()` returns two position vectors.  The region formed by these
positions indicate the minimum and maximum (respectively) positions of the area actually loaded in
the VoxelManip, which may be larger than the area requested.  For convenience, the loaded area
coordinates can also be queried any time after loading map data with `VoxelManip:get_emerged_area()`.

Now that the VoxelManip object is populated with map data, your mod can fetch a copy of this data
using either of two methods.  `VoxelManip:get_node_at()`, which retrieves an individual node in a
MapNode formatted table at the position requested is the simplest method to use, but also the slowest.

Nodes in a VoxelManip object may also be read in bulk to a flat array table using:
`VoxelManip:get_data()` for node content (in Content ID form, see section 'Content IDs'),
`VoxelManip:get_light_data()` for node light levels, and
`VoxelManip:get_param2_data()` for the node type-dependent "param2" values.

See section 'Flat array format' for more details.

It is very important to understand that the tables returned by any of the above three functions
represent a snapshot of the VoxelManip's internal state at the time of the call.  This copy of the
data will *not* magically update itself if another function modifies the internal VoxelManip state.
Any functions that modify a VoxelManip's contents work on the VoxelManip's internal state unless
otherwise explicitly stated.

Once the bulk data has been edited to your liking, the internal VoxelManip state can be set using:
`VoxelManip:set_data()` for node content (in Content ID form, see section 'Content IDs'),
`VoxelManip:set_light_data()` for node light levels, and
`VoxelManip:set_param2_data()` for the node type-dependent `param2` values.

The parameter to each of the above three functions can use any table at all in the same flat array
format as produced by `get_data()` et al. and is *not required* to be a table retrieved from `get_data()`.

Once the internal VoxelManip state has been modified to your liking, the changes can be committed back
to the map by calling `VoxelManip:write_to_map()`.


##### Flat array format
Let
    `Nx = p2.X - p1.X + 1`,
    `Ny = p2.Y - p1.Y + 1`, and
    `Nz = p2.Z - p1.Z + 1`.

Then, for a loaded region of p1..p2, this array ranges from `1` up to and including the value of
the expression `Nx * Ny * Nz`.

Positions offset from p1 are present in the array with the format of:

```
[
    (0, 0, 0),   (1, 0, 0),   (2, 0, 0),   ... (Nx, 0, 0),
    (0, 1, 0),   (1, 1, 0),   (2, 1, 0),   ... (Nx, 1, 0),
    ...
    (0, Ny, 0),  (1, Ny, 0),  (2, Ny, 0),  ... (Nx, Ny, 0),
    (0, 0, 1),   (1, 0, 1),   (2, 0, 1),   ... (Nx, 0, 1),
    ...
    (0, Ny, 2),  (1, Ny, 2),  (2, Ny, 2),  ... (Nx, Ny, 2),
    ...
    (0, Ny, Nz), (1, Ny, Nz), (2, Ny, Nz), ... (Nx, Ny, Nz)
]
```

and the array index for a position p contained completely in p1..p2 is:

`(p.Z - p1.Z) * Ny * Nx + (p.Y - p1.Y) * Nx + (p.X - p1.X) + 1`

Note that this is the same "flat 3D array" format as `PerlinNoiseMap:get3dMap_flat()`.
VoxelArea objects (see section 'VoxelArea') can be used to simplify calculation of the index
for a single point in a flat VoxelManip array.

##### Content IDs
A Content ID is a unique integer identifier for a specific node type.  These IDs are used by VoxelManip
in place of the node name string for `VoxelManip:get_data()` and `VoxelManip:set_data()`.  You can use
`minetest.get_content_id()` to look up the Content ID for the specified node name, and
`minetest.get_name_from_content_id()` to look up the node name string for a given Content ID.
After registration of a node, its Content ID will remain the same throughout execution of the mod.
Note that the node being queried needs to have already been been registered.

The following builtin node types have their Content IDs defined as constants:

* `minetest.CONTENT_UNKNOWN`:	ID for "unknown" nodes
* `minetest.CONTENT_AIR`:	ID for "air" nodes
* `minetest.CONTENT_IGNORE`:	ID for "ignore" nodes

##### Mapgen VoxelManip objects
Inside of `on_generated()` callbacks, it is possible to retrieve the same VoxelManip object used by the
core's Map Generator (commonly abbreviated Mapgen).  Most of the rules previously described still apply
but with a few differences:

* The Mapgen VoxelManip object is retrieved using: `minetest.get_mapgen_object("voxelmanip")`
* This VoxelManip object already has the region of map just generated loaded into it; it's not necessary
  to call `VoxelManip:read_from_map()` before using a Mapgen VoxelManip.
* The `on_generated()` callbacks of some mods may place individual nodes in the generated area using
  non-VoxelManip map modification methods.  Because the same Mapgen VoxelManip object is passed through
  each `on_generated()` callback, it becomes necessary for the Mapgen VoxelManip object to maintain
  consistency with the current map state.  For this reason, calling any of the following functions:
  `minetest.add_node()`, `minetest.set_node()`, or `minetest.swap_node()`
  will also update the Mapgen VoxelManip object's internal state active on the current thread.
* After modifying the Mapgen VoxelManip object's internal buffer, it may be necessary to update lighting
  information using either: `VoxelManip:calc_lighting()` or `VoxelManip:set_lighting()`.

##### Other API functions operating on a VoxelManip
If any VoxelManip contents were set to a liquid node, `VoxelManip:update_liquids()` must be called
for these liquid nodes to begin flowing.  It is recommended to call this function only after having
written all buffered data back to the VoxelManip object, save for special situations where the modder
desires to only have certain liquid nodes begin flowing.

The functions `minetest.generate_ores()` and `minetest.generate_decorations()` will generate all
registered decorations and ores throughout the full area inside of the specified VoxelManip object.

`minetest.place_schematic_on_vmanip()` is otherwise identical to `minetest.place_schematic()`,
except instead of placing the specified schematic directly on the map at the specified position, it
will place the schematic inside of the VoxelManip.

##### Notes
* Attempting to read data from a VoxelManip object before map is read will result in a zero-length
  array table for `VoxelManip:get_data()`, and an "ignore" node at any position for
  `VoxelManip:get_node_at()`.
* If either a region of map has not yet been generated or is out-of-bounds of the map, that region is
  filled with "ignore" nodes.
* Other mods, or the core itself, could possibly modify the area of map currently loaded into a VoxelManip
  object.  With the exception of Mapgen VoxelManips (see above section), the internal buffers are not
  updated.  For this reason, it is strongly encouraged to complete the usage of a particular VoxelManip
  object in the same callback it had been created.
* If a VoxelManip object will be used often, such as in an `on_generated()` callback, consider passing
  a file-scoped table as the optional parameter to `VoxelManip:get_data()`, which serves as a static
  buffer the function can use to write map data to instead of returning a new table each call.  This
  greatly enhances performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.

#### Methods
* `read_from_map(p1, p2)`:  Loads a chunk of map into the VoxelManip object containing
  the region formed by `p1` and `p2`.
    * returns actual emerged `pmin`, actual emerged `pmax`
* `write_to_map([light])`: Writes the data loaded from the `VoxelManip` back to the map.
    * **important**: data must be set using `VoxelManip:set_data()` before calling this
    * if `light` is true, then lighting is automatically recalculated.
      The default value is true.
      If `light` is false, no light calculations happen, and you should correct
      all modified blocks with `minetest.fix_light()` as soon as possible.
      Keep in mind that modifying the map where light is incorrect can cause
      more lighting bugs.
* `get_node_at(pos)`: Returns a `MapNode` table of the node currently loaded in
  the `VoxelManip` at that position
* `set_node_at(pos, node)`: Sets a specific `MapNode` in the `VoxelManip` at that position
* `get_data([buffer])`: Retrieves the node content data loaded into the `VoxelManip` object
    * returns raw node data in the form of an array of node content IDs
    * if the param `buffer` is present, this table will be used to store the result instead
* `set_data(data)`: Sets the data contents of the `VoxelManip` object
* `update_map()`: Does nothing, kept for compatibility.
* `set_lighting(light, [p1, p2])`: Set the lighting within the `VoxelManip` to a uniform value
    * `light` is a table, `{day=<0...15>, night=<0...15>}`
    * To be used only by a `VoxelManip` object from `minetest.get_mapgen_object`
    * (`p1`, `p2`) is the area in which lighting is set;
      defaults to the whole area if left out
* `get_light_data()`: Gets the light data read into the `VoxelManip` object
    * Returns an array (indices 1 to volume) of integers ranging from `0` to `255`
    * Each value is the bitwise combination of day and night light values (`0` to `15` each)
    * `light = day + (night * 16)`
* `set_light_data(light_data)`: Sets the `param1` (light) contents of each node
  in the `VoxelManip`
    * expects lighting data in the same format that `get_light_data()` returns
* `get_param2_data([buffer])`: Gets the raw `param2` data read into the `VoxelManip` object
    * Returns an array (indices 1 to volume) of integers ranging from `0` to `255`
    * If the param `buffer` is present, this table will be used to store the result instead
* `set_param2_data(param2_data)`: Sets the `param2` contents of each node in the `VoxelManip`
* `calc_lighting([p1, p2], [propagate_shadow])`:  Calculate lighting within the `VoxelManip`
    * To be used only by a `VoxelManip` object from `minetest.get_mapgen_object`
    * (`p1`, `p2`) is the area in which lighting is set; defaults to the whole area
      if left out or nil
    * `propagate_shadow` is an optional boolean deciding whether shadows in a generated
      mapchunk above are propagated down into the mapchunk; defaults to `true` if left out
* `update_liquids()`: Update liquid flow
* `was_modified()`: Returns `true` or `false` if the data in the voxel manipulator
  had been modified since the last read from map, due to a call to
  `minetest.set_data()` on the loaded area elsewhere
* `get_emerged_area()`: Returns actual emerged minimum and maximum positions.

### `VoxelArea`
A helper class for voxel areas.
It can be created via `VoxelArea:new{MinEdge=pmin, MaxEdge=pmax}`.
The coordinates are *inclusive*, like most other things in Minetest.

#### Methods
* `getExtent()`: returns a 3D vector containing the size of the area formed by
  `MinEdge` and `MaxEdge`
* `getVolume()`: returns the volume of the area formed by `MinEdge` and `MaxEdge`
* `index(x, y, z)`: returns the index of an absolute position in a flat array starting at `1`
    * useful for things like `VoxelManip`, raw Schematic specifiers,
      `PerlinNoiseMap:get2d`/`3dMap`, and so on
* `indexp(p)`: same as above, except takes a vector
* `position(i)`: returns the absolute position vector corresponding to index `i`
* `contains(x, y, z)`: check if (`x`,`y`,`z`) is inside area formed by `MinEdge` and `MaxEdge`

    * from (`minx`,`miny`,`minz`) to (`maxx`,`maxy`,`maxz`) in the order of `[z [y [x]]]`
* `iterp(minp, maxp)`: same as above, except takes a vector

### `Settings`
An interface to read config files in the format of `minetest.conf`.

It can be created via `Settings(filename)`.

#### Methods
* `get(key)`: returns a value
* `get_bool(key, [default])`: returns a boolean
    * `default` is the value returned if `key` is not found.
    * Returns `nil` if `key` is not found and `default` not specified.
* `get_np_group(key)`: returns a NoiseParams table
* `set(key, value)`
    * Setting names can't contain whitespace or any of `="{}#`.
    * Setting values can't contain the sequence `\n"""`.
    * Setting names starting with "secure." can't be set on the main settings object (`minetest.settings`).
* `set_bool(key, value)`

### `Raycast`
A raycast on the map. It works with selection boxes.
Can be used as an iterator in a for loop.

The map is loaded as the ray advances. If the
map is modified after the `Raycast` is created,
the changes may or may not have an effect on
the object.

It can be created via `Raycast(pos1, pos2, objects, liquids)` or
`minetest.raycast(pos1, pos2, objects, liquids)` where:
    * `pos1`: start of the ray
    * `pos2`: end of the ray
    * `objects` : if false, only nodes will be returned. Default is true.
    * `liquids' : if false, liquid nodes won't be returned. Default is false.

#### Methods
* `next()`: returns a `pointed_thing`
    * Returns the next thing pointed by the ray or nil.

Mapgen objects
--------------
A mapgen object is a construct used in map generation. Mapgen objects can be used
by an `on_generate` callback to speed up operations by avoiding unnecessary
recalculations; these can be retrieved using the `minetest.get_mapgen_object()`
function. If the requested Mapgen object is unavailable, or `get_mapgen_object()`
was called outside of an `on_generate()` callback, `nil` is returned.

The following Mapgen objects are currently available:

### `voxelmanip`
This returns three values; the `VoxelManip` object to be used, minimum and maximum
emerged position, in that order. All mapgens support this object.

### `heightmap`
Returns an array containing the y coordinates of the ground levels of nodes in
the most recently generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `biomemap`
Returns an array containing the biome IDs of nodes in the most recently
generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `heatmap`
Returns an array containing the temperature values of nodes in the most
recently generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `humiditymap`
Returns an array containing the humidity values of nodes in the most recently
generated chunk by the current mapgen.

### `gennotify`
Returns a table mapping requested generation notification types to arrays of
positions at which the corresponding generated structures are located at within
the current chunk. To set the capture of positions of interest to be recorded
on generate, use `minetest.set_gen_notify()`.

Possible fields of the table returned are:

* `dungeon`
* `temple`
* `cave_begin`
* `cave_end`
* `large_cave_begin`
* `large_cave_end`
* `decoration`

Decorations have a key in the format of `"decoration#id"`, where `id` is the
numeric unique decoration ID.

Registered entities
-------------------
* Functions receive a "luaentity" as `self`:
    * It has the member `.name`, which is the registered name `("mod:thing")`
    * It has the member `.object`, which is an `ObjectRef` pointing to the object
    * The original prototype stuff is visible directly via a metatable
* Callbacks:
    * `on_activate(self, staticdata, dtime_s)`
        * Called when the object is instantiated.
        * `dtime_s` is the time passed since the object was unloaded, which can
          be used for updating the entity state.
    * `on_step(self, dtime)`
        * Called on every server tick, after movement and collision processing.
          `dtime` is usually 0.1 seconds, as per the `dedicated_server_step` setting
          `in minetest.conf`.
    * `on_punch(self, puncher, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, dir)`
        * Called when somebody punches the object.
        * Note that you probably want to handle most punches using the
          automatic armor group system.
          * `puncher`: an `ObjectRef` (can be `nil`)
          * `time_from_last_punch`: Meant for disallowing spamming of clicks (can be `nil`)
          * `tool_capabilities`: capability table of used tool (can be `nil`)
          * `dir`: unit vector of direction of punch. Always defined. Points from
            the puncher to the punched.
    * `on_death(self, killer)`
        * Called when the object dies.
          * `killer`: an `ObjectRef` (can be `nil`)
    * `on_rightclick(self, clicker)`
    * `get_staticdata(self)`
        * Should return a string that will be passed to `on_activate` when
          the object is instantiated the next time.

L-system trees
--------------
**Warning**
L-system generation currently creates lighting bugs in the form of mapblock-sized shadows.
Often these bugs appear as subtle shadows in water.

### Tile definition
* `"image.png"`

* `{name="image.png", backface_culling=bool, tileable_vertical=bool,
    tileable_horizontal=bool, align_style="node"/"world"/"user", scale=int}`
    * backface culling enabled by default for most nodes
    * tileable flags are info for shaders, how they should treat texture
      when displacement mapping is used
      Directions are from the point of view of the tile texture,
      not the node it's on
    * align style determines whether the texture will be rotated with the node
          or kept aligned with its surroundings. "user" means that client
          setting will be used, similar to `glasslike_framed_optional`.
          Note: supported by solid nodes and nodeboxes only.
    * scale is used to make texture span several (exactly `scale`) nodes,
          instead of just one, in each direction. Works for world-aligned
          textures only.
          Note that as the effect is applied on per-mapblock basis, `16` should
          be equally divisible by `scale` or you may get wrong results.
* `{name="image.png", color=ColorSpec}`
    * the texture's color will be multiplied with this color.
    * the tile's color overrides the owning node's color in all cases.
* deprecated, yet still supported field names:
    * `image` (name)
