# MOBS REDO for MINETEST

Built from PilzAdam's original Simple Mobs with additional mobs by KrupnoPavel,
Zeg9, ExeterDad and AspireMint.

This mod contains the API only for adding your own mobs into the world, so
please use the additional modpacks to add animals, monsters, and npcs.

## Crafts

- **Nametag**. Can be crafted by paper, black dye, and string. Can be used
  to right-click on a tamed mob to give them a name.
- **Net**. Used to right-click tamed mobs to pick them up and place inside
  inventory as a spawn egg.
- **Magic lasso**. Similar to nets but with a better chance of picking up
  larger mobs.
- **Shears**. Used to right-click sheep and return 1-3 wool.
- **Protection Rune**. Protects tamed mobs from being harmed by other players.
- **Mob Fence and Fence Top**. Stops mobs escaping or glitching throughfences.
- Add mobs:mob_repellent block to stop mobs spawning within 16 node radius.

**Lucky Blocks**: 13
