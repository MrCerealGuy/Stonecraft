## Latex

<img src="../textures/technic_raw_latex.png"/>

Latex is used for manufacturing rubber, which is heavily used for the medium- and high-voltage components within Technic. Latex can be harvested directly from rubber trees (look for the pale green/seafoam leaves) using the tree tap like any other tool. Rubber trees regenerate their latex supplies after about a day.
