FPGAs can be used to chain multiple logic gates together in a compact manner.
They come with 4 I/O ports and 10 internal registers,
which can then be connected with eachother to form logic circuits.<br />
Supported gate types: <b>AND</b>, <b>OR</b>, <b>NOT</b>, <b>XOR</b>, <b>NAND</b>, <b>XNOR</b>, <b>Buffer</b> (=)<br />
I/O ports: <b>A B C D</b>; Registers: numbered <b>0</b> to <b>9</b>
