# Use smallest area volume precedence concept. (experimental; may change)

# If set to `true`:
#    The interaction permission is defined by the smallest area volume that
#    contains the interaction position. Granting access to areas is achieved
#    by factions instead of using `/add_owner`.
#    This allows players to have private areas within a greater open/shared
#    area and also define open/shared areas within those private areas.
# If set to `false`: (default)
#    Interacting is permitted if the interaction position resides in any of the
#    player's own areas, shared or open areas.
#    This permission is not impacted by more restrictive, intersecting areas.
