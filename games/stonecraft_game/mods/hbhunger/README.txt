About hunger
============
This mod adds a hunger mechanic to the game.
A new player starts with 20 satiation points out of 30.
Player actions like digging, placing and walking cause exhausion, which lower the player's
satiation. Also every 800 seconds you lose 1 satiation point without doing anything.
If you are hungry (0 satiation) you will suffer damage and die in case you don't eat something.
If your satiation is greater than 15, you will slowly regenerate health points.
Eating food will increase your satiation.
Important: Eating food will not directly increase your health anymore, as long as the food item
is supported by this mod (see below).


Currently supported food:
-------------------------
- Apples (default)
- Animalmaterials (mobf modpack)
- Bread (default)
- Bushes
- bushes_classic
- Creatures
- Dwarves (beer and such)
- Docfarming
- Fishing
- Farming plus
- Farming (default and Tenplus1's fork)
- Food
- fruit
- Glooptest
- JKMod
- kpgmobs
- Mobfcooking
- Mooretrees
- Mtfoods
- mushroom
- mush45
- Seaplants (sea)
- Simple mobs

Examples: 
Eating an apple (from the default Minetest game) increases your satiation by 2,
eating a bread (from the default Minetest game) increases your satiation by 4.
