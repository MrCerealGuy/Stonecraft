Ambience Lite API
=================

This short guide will show you how to add sound sets into ambience mod for the
api to use and play sounds accordingly.  Please note that the order they are
added will affect sound checks, so high priority sets first.


Function Usage
==============


Adding Sound Set
----------------

ambience.add_set(set_name, def)
  'set_name' contains the name of the sound set to add
  'def' contains the following:
     'frequency' how often the sound set is played (1 to 1000) higher is more
     'nodes' contains a table of nodes needed for checks
     'sound_check(def)' function to check if sounds can be played, def contains:
        'player' player userdata
        'pos' position of player
        'tod' time of day
        'totals' totals for each node e.g. def.totals["default:sand"]
        'positions' position data for every node found
        'head_node' name of node at player head level
        'feet_node' nameof node at player foot level

This will let you add a set or sounds with the frequency it's used and check
function for it to play.  If ephemeral is true then no handler will be used and sound will be played in background alongside other sounds.

e.g.

ambience.add_set("windy", {
	frequency = 500,
	nodes = {"default:sand"},
	sounds = {
		{name = "wind", length = 9, gain = 0.3},
		{name = "desertwind", length = 8, gain = 0.3},
		{name = "crow", length = 3, ephemeral = true},
	},
	sound_check = function(def)
		local number = totals["default:sand"] or 0 -- yep, can also be nil
		if number > 20 then
			return "windy", 0.2 -- return set to play and optional gain volume
		end
	end,
})


Getting Sound Set
-----------------

ambience.get_set(set_name)

This returns a table containing all of the set information like example above.

e.g.

local myset = ambience.get_set("windy") -- returns everything inside {} above.


Deleting Sound Set
------------------

ambience.del_set(set_name)

This will remove a sound set from the list.

e.g.

ambience.del_set("windy")


Additional Commands
===================

Two volume commands have been added to set sound and music volume:

/svol (0.1 to 1.0)
/mvol (0.1 to 1.0) -- 0 can be used to stop music from playing when it begins


Music
=====

Music can be stored in the sounds folder either on server or locally and so long
as it is named 'ambience_music.1', 'ambience_music.2' etc. then it will select
a song randomly at midnight and play player.
