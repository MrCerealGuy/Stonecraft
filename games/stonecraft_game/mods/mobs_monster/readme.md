# MONSTER MOBS

This mod creates many types of monsters. Some are weak, some are powerful, and they generally do the player a lot of harm. Many of these monsters spawn below ground and take light damage.

**Lucky Blocks**: 12

## Dirt Monster

Dirt monsters spawn at night on green grass (or grey in `ethereal`). They have a tendency to wander around looking for a player to eat and drop 1-2 dirt when killed. Dirt monsters have between 3-27 health, take damage in sunlight, and deal very little damage.

# Dungeon Master

Dungeon masters spawn below -70 underground DM's and hurl fireballs at unsuspecting players and can cause major damage, but get too close and he will switch to dogfight attack. They have between 42 and 75 health points. Their melee attack deals six damage points and their fireball inflicts eight. The fireball will also explode if it hits a node. They drop mese or diamond when killed.

# Lava Flan

Cute as they may look, lava flan wallow in their namesake (no, not flans) and get curious about players who wander by, forgetting that they can burn you and cause damage. They have a 1 in 5 chance of dropping lava orb when killed, but if they die in water then pray they dont solidify into an obsidian flan that shoots shards and destroys all around them.

# Mese Monster

These mobs are territorial and spawn below -20 and will fire mese shards at passers by, so best avoided. The deeper you go the tougher they seem to get. Will drop mese when killed. Another thing - they do not take damage from many weapons.

# Oerkki

Found in dark areas like most monsters, Oerkki wander the caverns stealing away torches on the ground and attacking anyone found in that area. 1 in 3 chance of dropping obsidian.

# Sand Monster

The hot deserts are home to these guys who spawn at any time of the day to attack players. They drop 3-5 desert sand when killed. A single sand monster isn't much of a threat - they deal one damage point.

# Spiders

Snowy spiders are found on higher cold areas, spitting Tarantula's in higher jungle, small Cave spider below -20 and Mese spider near areas containing the ore and Crystal spiders only in Ethereal's crystal biomes. Some are docile during the daytime and will drop string when killed.

# Stone Monster

Found underground in dark caves, these mobs seem to be zombie-like in fashion with a tendency to rush a player in the area. They can drop torch, iron or coal when killed.

# Tree Monster

Found atop trees at night time they drop down and look for food in the form of players and animals. Can drop saplings and sometimes an apple or three depending on type.  Also note that green tree creepers exist and sometimes go boom.

# Land Guard

These huge monsters roam the land in cold, hot and temperate areas and don't like players wandering around their domain. They have between 60 and 130 health points and deal 15 damage, enough to kill you in two blows.

# Fire Spirit

Fire Spirits will not tolerate players roaming around their domain and will fiercely attack until their dying puff of smoke. They will drop their spirit and some fire dust when using ethereal.
