Notes:
------

Beech trees are meant to replace default trees, but are themselves disabled by default.  They grow in the same areas
as the default ones do, and under the same conditions.

Acacia trees depend on humidity as their primary control, and they don't use the fertile ground option. They grow near
the edges of a desert biome, occasionally into the grass beyond, and anywhere else on desert sand or dirt with grass,
where the humidity is low (but not bone dry).

Fir trees appear in a snow biome only with older versions of SPlizard's Snow Biomes mod.  In more recent versions,
these trees will not grow, due to an engine bug.
