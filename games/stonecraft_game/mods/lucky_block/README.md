Lucky Block mod [lucky_block]

This mod adds a new and exciting block to the game which when broken can give
the player something good, surprising, bad, hurtful or just simply a troll.

Lucky Blocks can be crafted with 1 chest surrounded by gold ingots.

The api.txt document shows how to add your own blocks to the list by using
one of the 9 commands included and the blocks.lua file gives you many examples
by using some of the popular mods available.
