Lucky Block API
===============

This guide will show you how to add schematic files and lucky blocks from
within your own mods.  Please make sure that lucky_block appears in the
depends.txt file of your mod so everything work properly.


Function Usage
==============


Purge Block List
----------------

lucky_block:purge_block_list()

This command is used to clear all of the blocks in the lucky block list so that
you can add your own.


Add Lucky Blocks to list
------------------------

lucky_block:add_blocks({ block definitions here })

This command is used to add new blocks to the lucky block list.

e.g.

lucky_block:add_blocks({
	{"nod", "default:dirt", 0},
	{"dro", {"default:dirt"}, 5},
})


Purge Chest Items
-----------------

lucky_block:purge_chest_items()

This command is used to purge all items in the default chest list so that you
can add your own.


Add Items to Default Chest
--------------------------

lucky_block:add_chest_items({ add new default chest items here })

This command lets you add new items to the default chest when it appears
inside a lucky block.

e.g.

lucky_block:add_chest_items({
	{name = "default:apple", max = 3},
	{name = "default:steel_ingot", max = 2},
	{name = "default:pick_steel", max = 1}
})


Add Schematics to List
----------------------

lucky_block:add_schematics({ add new schematic definitions here })

This command lets you add schematic files and arrays to the list so they can
be added to the lucky block list.

e.g. check for Ethereal mod then get the path and add two of the tree's to the
schematic list and finally to the lucky block list:

if minetest.get_modpath("ethereal") then
	local path = minetest.get_modpath("ethereal") .. "/schematics/"

	lucky_block:add_schematics({
		-- name on list, schematic, offset placement
		{"appletree", ethereal.appletree, {x = 1, y = 0, z = 1}},
		{"bananatree", ethereal.bananatree, {x = 3, y = 0, z = 3}},
	}

	lucky_block:add_blocks({
		{"sch", "appletree", 0, false},
		{"sch", "bananatree", 0, false},
	})
end


Open Lucky Block
----------------

lucky_block:open(pos, digger, blocks_list)

This is the function called when the default lucky block has been dug, it will
use the default blocks list or use a custom one when supplied so that modders
can add their own lucky block sets.

e.g.

local my_blocks = {
	{"nod", "default:wood"},
	{"dro", {"default:tree", "default:jungletree"}, 5},
	{"exp"},
}

minetest.register_node('mymod:my_lucky_block', {
	description = "My Lucky Block",
	tiles = {"mymod_lucky_block.png"},
	paramtype = "light",
	groups = {oddly_breakable_by_hand = 3},
	drop = {},
	sounds = default.node_sound_wood_defaults(),

	on_dig = function(pos, node, digger)
		minetest.remove_node(pos) -- remove lucky block
		lucky_block:open(pos, digger, my_blocks) -- use custom blocks list
	end,
})


Lucky Block Commands
====================

Using the lucky_block:add_blocks() command gives you access to many features
from within this mod, these are listed below using this general format:

lucky_block:add_blocks({
	{"command", command options},
	..etc
})


Place Node
----------

This command will place a node in place of the lucky block or at the players
standing position.

{"nod", "node name", position, chest items}

e.g.

Place a dirt block where lucky block was

	{"nod", "default:dirt", 0}

Place a chest containing random items from default chest items list

	{"nod", "default:chest", 0}

Place chest as above only add up to 5x roses as well

	{"nod", "default:chest", 0, { {name = "flowers:rose, max = 4} }}

Place fire at player position

	{"nod", "fire:basic_flame", 1}


Drop Item(s)
------------

This command will throw a single or multiple items out of a lucky block,
random colours can be used also.

{"dro", {"item names"}, how many to drop, use random colours}

e.g.

Drop 5x torches as itemstack
	{"dro", {"default:torch"}, 5}

Drop 10x randomly coloured wool (colour name added to end of item string)
	{"dro", {"wool:"}, 10, true}

Drop 1x random tool from list
	{"dro", {"default:pick_mese", "default:shovel_steel", "default:axe_diamond"}, 1}


Place Schematic
---------------

This command lets you place a pre-added schematic file or definition in place
of the lucky block or at the player position.

{"sch", "schematic name", position, force placement, replacements}

e.g.

Place lucky platform at player position and force placement
	{"sch", "platform", 1, true}

Place apple tree where lucky block use to be
	{"sch", "appletree", 0, false}

Place apple tree where lucky block use to be and change wood into stone
	{"sch", "appletree", 0, false, {{"default:wood", "default:stone"}} }


Spawn Entity or Mob
-------------------

This command allows you to place a monster, animal or other entity.

{"spw", {"entity name"}, how many to spawn, tamed, owned, range, nametag}

e.g.

Spawn 2x Dirt or Stone Monsters over a radius of 10 blocks
	{"spw", {"mobs:dirt_monster", "mobs:stone_monster"}, 2, nil, nil, 10}

Spawn 5x randomly coloured sheep (random colour only works with Mobs Redo sheep)
	{"spw", "mobs:sheep", 5}

Spawn a single NPC who is tamed and owned by player and called "Bob"
	{"spw", "mobs:npc", 1, true, true, 1, "Bob"}


Falling Blocks
--------------

This command allows for a tower of blocks or blocks falling within a set area.

{"fal", {"node list"}, position, spread, range}

e.g.

Drop 2x sand and 1x gold block spread over a range of 5 blocks

	{"fal", {"default:sand", "default:sand", "default:goldblock"}, 0, true, 5}

Drop 3x obsidian onto player as a tower
	{"fal", {"default:obsidian", "default:obsidian", "default:obsidian"}, 1}


Troll Block
-----------

This command is similar to the place node command only it allows for a sound to
be played on placement, then after two seconds the block will disappear or
can explode causing damage to nearby players.

{"tro", "node name", "sound", explode}

e.g.

Add diamond block then after 2 seconds remove with explosion

	{"tro", "default:diamondblock", nil, true}

Add gold block with wood sound, then after 2 seconds remove with pop

	{"tro", "default:goldblock", "default_wood_footstep", nil}


Random Teleport
---------------

This command will teleport the player opening the lucky block a random number
of blocks away using a preset range.

{"tel", horizontal range, vertical range}

e.g.

Teleport player to random position 10 blocks left/right and 5 blocks up/under

	{"tel", 10, 5}


Explosion
---------

Now we start adding the bad lucky blocks that cause damage to the player by
adding explosions.

{"exp", radius}

e.g.

Cause explosion with damage radius of 4.

{"exp", 4}


Lightning Strike
----------------

This is one of my favourite commands, lightning strikes the player and hurts
everyone else nearby, can also place fire at strike position.

{"lig", "fire node"}

e.g.

Strike player and place temporary fire

	{"lig", "fire:basic_flame"}

Strike player and place permanent flame

	{"lig", "fire:permanent_flame"}


Floor Placement
---------------

This feature places random blocks from the list provided to make a floor under
the lucky block with a pause after each block.

{"flo", width, {node_list}, offset},

e.g.

Place a three wide obsidian and gold block floor with offset of 1 to centre on
lucky block

	{"flo", 3, {"default:goldblock", "default:obsidian"}, 1}

Have a woolen floor at 5 width with offset of 2 to keep it centred

	{"flo", 5, {"wool:red", "wool:blue", "wool:white", "wool:orange"}, 2}


Custom Function
---------------

This allows mod makers to use there own functions when opening lucky blocks and
passes the block position and player opening it.

{"cus", myfunction}

e.g.

Punch player and deal 5 damage points (function first then line to add l.block)

local function punchy(pos, player)
	player:punch(player, 1.0, {
		full_punch_interval = 1.0,
		damage_groups = {fleshy = 5}
	}, nil)
end

	{"cus", punchy}
