Not So Simple Mobs by NPX team

Starting from version 3.0 the mod depends on mobs_redo api: https://github.com/tenplus1/mobs_redo

We suggest that you play nssm with:
 - nssb (Not So Simple Buildings, our second mod that adds many blocks and Morlendor, the new dimension):
 - 3d_armors (with which you can use nssm armors):
 - unified_inventory (useful to discover all the new recipes and to use the armors):
 - a throwing mod (a mod that add bows) if compatible with the Tenplus1's damage_system

We would like to thank:
 - PilzAdam, for his wonderful simple-mobs mod;
 - Tenplus1, for his hard work in making mobs_redo;
 - Echoes91, for Spears: simple but amazing;
 - and obviously Celeron-55 and all the people who contributed to Minetest and its community (and Paramat in particular);
 - Denise and Ponzi_Duro for the revision of the guide;
 - Double_P, Ponzi_Duro, Andrey01 and Taikedz for the beta testing;
 - Taikedz for his support and for hosting a server dedicated to nssm (Not So Simple Server: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=15435&hilit=nsss);

The mod makes the game really hard, please read the wiki before playing: http://wiki.minetest.net/Mods/Not_So_Simple_Mobs (which will be updated as soon as possible) or the old guide for the 2.4 version.
