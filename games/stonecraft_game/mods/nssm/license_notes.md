# About the license

This fork was made after NPX silently left the community circa 2016-2017.

NPX originally licensed their code under "GPLv3" , then later switched it to "LGPL" without specifying a version.

## Choice of new license

[The Free Software Foundation's license compatibility matrix][1] indicates:

* software licensed under any LGPL version can be redistributed under the GPLv3
* any `LGPLv2.1 or later` or `LGPLv3` can be redistributed under LGPLv3

Since we cannot have formal clarity on what verion of the LGPL was intended by NPX, this software fork is now being licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.0.

## Intermediate commits

Intermediate commits of the code since abandonment indicated use of the LGPLv2.1-or-later license; this was inappropriate. Please avoid using copies of the code distributed prior to this new, clean relicensing.
