2013-04-30:  Multiple changes

* Refactored the code to use default "common" dyes
rather than directly from flowers.

* This mod now depends on "default" and "dye" from the Minetest common
sub-game.  Since the default dye mod uses default flowers, this mod no
longer checks for what version of flowers you're using, or even depends
on it.

* Bottle-based textures have been replaced with piles of dye powder, based
on the default red dye texture.

* All dyes are obtained by crafting, not cooking, for consistency with the 
default dye mod.

* The somewhat-complicated method using separate "pigment" powders, glass
bottles and "liquid dye base" has been done away with.  Now it's just
dry dye powders, as with the default dye mod.

* Also, got rid of the whole paint scheme, in favor of dry powders.

* All old dyes, paints, and Unified Dyes pigment powders have been aliased
back to the standard dye powders.

2012-07-26: Added a "version" check for the flowers dependency: If the 
flowers mod defines "flowers:flower_geranium" (as is the case with my 
update of 2012-08-01), then those will be used to get blue pigment 
powder, and violas will produce violet powder, both of which can be 
directly used to create their respective liquid dye colors.  If it is 
not defined (e.g. the user has an older version of the flowers mod), 
then violas produce blue dye powder.  Violet dye can still be formed by 
mixing blue and magenta or blue and red dyes, as before.

2012-07-26: Better bottle textures.  Note that these are blended against 
the 50% grey field they normally appear on in the inventory display, so 
they will show artifacts if you try to wield them.  Don't do that. :-)

2012-07-26: Split off glass bottles into a separate mod, "Vessels".  
This mod now depends on it.

2012-07-25 (almost immediately after): Fixed a copy&paste error for 
black dye.

2012-07-25: Replaced missing craftitem entries and got rid of some 
redundant code left over from last update.  Added group settings for all 
dyes according to recently-published standard.  Fixed a few typos in 
item descriptions, and straightened up capitalization.

2012-07-24: Added some extra steps to the dye-making process, added 
recommendation that empty bottles be given back to the player on use.  
Dyes are still easy to make, they just require a more realistic (and 
this, harder) process now.

2012-07-16 (a bit later): fixed a minor error in generation of medium 
grey.

2012-07-16: Added a new set of colors, "light" (brightness of 150% 
versus the 'full' shade), for a total of 89.  No 50% saturation version 
of this set.  Added a palette image showing the full set of colors.

2012-07-13: Fixed some missing commas.

2012-07-13: Added a script to aid in the generation of new textures for 
mods that depend on unifieddyes.  Moved this changelog from the forum 
into the distribution directory.  Rewrote the README to contain 
everything from the forum post, and expanded it to document the new 
generation script.

2012-07-12 (a bit later): added groups = {dye=1}, to each 
register_craftitem call, to make it easier for other mods to identify 
the dyes and categorize them.

2012-07-12: moved project to github.

2012-07-11 (continuing): Tweaked the script to remove titanium dioxide 
from the output, since it isn't intended to be directly used as a 
dye/paint (but rather, to make paint that can then be used).  
Regenerated colors.txt.

2012-07-11 (immediately after): The script was reading the wrong pixel 
from the image, resulting in lighter-than-correct colors.  Fixed it and 
regenerated the colors.txt file.

2012-07-11: Added a script to list all of the colors and their RGB 
values and texture filenames, and a text file containing the output 
thereof.

2012-07-08 (a bit later): deleted a few unused files (copy&paste error).

2012-07-08: Major boost in the number of available colors - was 8, now 
77.  Should cover pretty much the entire spectrum of colors one might 
use in this game.

2012-07-02: Deleted a few redundant files (leftovers from when I wanted 
to merge in flowers and then changed my mind).

2012-06-26: Initial upload.
