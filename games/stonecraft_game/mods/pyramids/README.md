# Pyramids (with Treasurer support) [`tsm_pyramids`]

* Version: 1.0.4

## Description
This is a mod for Minetest Game which adds randomly spawned pyramids in deserts and
sandstone deserts. The pyramids are very rare and contain chests with stuff.
Also there are mummies inside, which attack the player if found in their radius.

## Historic notes
This mod is a fork of the old `pyramids` mod by BlockMen and intended to be a direct
(but unofficial) successor of it.
