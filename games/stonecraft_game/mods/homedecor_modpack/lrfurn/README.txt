Living Room Furniture (lrfurn) mod for Minetest


by thefamilygrog66

Description:
Coloured Long Sofas (3 blocks wide), Sofas (2 blocks wide), Armchairs, Coffee Tables and End Tables, loosely based on PilzAdam's beds mod. There are 9 colours in all: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, black, grey and white.

When you right-click on a long sofa, sofa or armchair, it transports you onto it, and replenishes your HP. Good if you've just escaped nasty mobs, didn't fare so well in battle, or just had a bad fall. The coffee table - which isn't coloured, just wooden - is pretty much just for decoration. It stands half a block high and nearly 2 blocks long. The end table is similar to the coffee table, though roughly half the length (i.e. only one block) and square.
