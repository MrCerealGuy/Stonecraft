Bonemeal mod [bonemeal]

This mod adds four new items into the game, bones which can be dug from normal
dirt which can be made into bonemeal, mulch which is is crafted using a tree and
8x leaves, and fertiliser which is a mixture of them both.

Each item can be used on saplings and crops for a chance to grow them quicker as
well as dirt which will generate random grass, flowers or whichever decoration
is registered.

Mulch has a strength of 1, Bonemeal 2 and Fertiliser 3 which means the stronger
the item, the more chance of growing saplings in low light, making crops sprout
quicker or simply decorate a larger area with grass and flowers.

The api.txt document shows how to add your own saplings, crops and grasses to
the list by using one of the 3 commands included and the mod.lua file gives you
many examples by using some of the popular mods available.
