Version: 2.1


Adds sheep to Minetest (requires Creatures MOB-Engine).
Sheep spawn only at day-time and are friendly and remain around 5 minutes in the world.
There are four different wool colors: white, grey, brown and black.
You can tame them by feading them with wheat. If there is grass they eat the grass
and regrow wool that way. They will follow you if you have Wheat in your hand.
Sheep have 8 HP and drop 1-2 wool when punched or 1-3 wool when using shears.

Sheers are crafted by using 2 steel ingots and one stick in following shape:

  - 	ingot
ingot 	stick
