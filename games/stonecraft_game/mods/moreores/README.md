[**Forum topic**](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=549)

## Installation

### Download the mod

To install More Ores, clone this Git repository into your Minetest's `mods/`
directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minetest-mods/moreores.git
```

You can also
[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/minetest-mods/moreores/archive/master.zip)
of More Ores.

### Enable the mod

Once you have installed More Ores, you need to enable it in Minetest.
The procedure is as follows:

#### Using the client's main menu

This is the easiest way to enable More Ores when playing in singleplayer
(or on a server hosted from a client).

1. Start Minetest and switch to the **Local Game** tab.
2. Select the world you want to enable More Ores in.
3. Click **Configure**, then enable `moreores` by double-clicking it
   (or ticking the **Enabled** checkbox).
4. Save the changes, then start a game on the world you enabled More Ores on.
5. More Ores should now be running on your world.

#### Using a text editor

This is the recommended way to enable the mod on a server without using a GUI.

1. Make sure Minetest is not currently running (otherwise, it will overwrite
   the changes when exiting).
2. Open the world's `world.mt` file using a text editor.
3. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```text
load_mod_moreores = true
```

If the line is already present in the file, then replace `false` with `true`
on that line.

4. Save the file, then start a game on the world you enabled More Ores on.
5. More Ores should now be running on your world.

## Version compatibility

More Ores is currently primarily tested with Minetest 5.1.0.
It may or may not work with newer or older versions. Issues arising in older
versions than 5.0.0 will generally not be fixed.
