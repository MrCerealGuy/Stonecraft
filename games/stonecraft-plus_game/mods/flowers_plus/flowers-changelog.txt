Changelog
---------

2012-08-06: Tweaked selection boxes on all nodes.  Tweaked seaweed to use 
signlike instead of raillike drawtype, (still forced to only spawn flat as 
usual).  Adjusted light level limits to give it more time to grow.  Created 
this changelog file using github commit messages as the basis.  Shrunk the 
geranium flower down a bit to better match the others.

2012-08-03: Tuned out the random-numbers-inside-ABM stuff. Uses the ABM's 
chance setting instead.  Should be approximately the same as before, but 
hopefully using a tad less CPU.  Minor tweak to ABM interval/growing delay.

2012-08-01: Added blue geranium to the collection of flowers.

2012-07-31: Disable debug by default.

2012-07-30: many updates over the course of the day - first commit, removed 
some redundant files, added wield/inventory image entries for each item, to 
force the game to draw them properly (these shouldn't be needed, must be a 
bug).  Tweaked spawn code so that the radius check also includes the name of 
the item being spawned as well as items in group:flower, that way all items can 
have a radius test, and not just those in group:flower. Fiddled with the spawn 
rates a bit.
